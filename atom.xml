    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Great article in <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/11/sir-david-attenborough-enough-with-the-creationists-and-climate-change-deniers.html">The Daily Beast</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Sir David Attenborough is one of the great naturalists of our time, celebrated for decades of peerless documentary making, an infectious love of the animal kingdom and that distinctive and enthusiastic whisper. Once criticized by campaigners for his reticence to address contentious issues, Attenborough is no longer willing to speak in hushed tones.</p>

<p>Sitting opposite the kangaroo enclosure at London Zoo, he told The Daily Beast he had lost patience with the “ignorance” of creationists, polluters, and climate change deniers. “To simply say that you must accept unquestioningly what you learned at your mother’s knee is not the act of an intelligent person,” he said.</p></blockquote>

<p>He vents his frustration with religious zealots</p>

<blockquote><p>Every society in the world has found it necessary to produce a story to account for the fact that humanity is on earth,” he said. “The Australian Aboriginals think that the first humans were regurgitated by a great rainbow serpent in the sky, the people in Thailand think the beginning of the world was a huge pool of milk and a snake was pulled by demons, and the milk coagulated and that formed human beings and there was a time, two and a half to three thousand years ago, when people on the east end of the Mediterranean thought woman was made from the rib of the first man.</p>

<p>“If somebody says to me I believe every word of the Bible is true, you can’t argue against that degree of irrationality…there is actually a way of looking at the natural world and seeing the evidence and it’s all there. And what’s more it’s the same evidence whether it’s in Australia or Northern Europe or wherever. It’s all the same—it all produces the same answer and you can all see the evidence—if you reject that then there’s nothing I can say.”</p></blockquote>

<p>David Attenborough has produced many great programs on evolution, one of the recent ones is <em><a href="http://www.riseofanimals.com/">The Rise of Animals</a></em>, currently showing on ABC1</p>

<p><img src="http://nsewell.com//images/customs-propaganda.jpg"></p>

<p>The Australian public is being kept in the dark like never before about the number of boat arrivals and the conditions of the detention camps. The public is allowed to know that the camps <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-28/immigration-department-breaks-down-asylum-detention-costs/4718730">cost $1.5 billion each year to operate</a>, but the government has effectively denied Australian journalists any real coverage of the conditions in the camps. The politically motivated <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/expulsion-from-nauru-false-and-ridiculous-exiled-judge-20140121-316xa.html">expulsion of a judge from Nauru</a> before an inquiry into their detention camps is another way in which secrecy is being maintained.</p>

<p>The Abbott government claims that they have a mandate to &#8220;stop the boats.&#8221; It&#8217;s unclear if the people that gave them that mandate understand what is happening with their money, in their name.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bill Nye recently debated the world&#8217;s leading apologist for Young Earth Creationism, Ken Ham. Ham believes that nothing can ever dispove a 6,000 year old earth, and that <a href="www.awkwardmomentsbible.com/unicorns/">unicorns are real animals</a>. Many atheists and scientists opposed the debate, as they were concerned it would legitimise pseudoscience as worthy of scientific consideration, and give money to Ham to build his full scale &#8220;replica&#8221; of the ark. After the event most commentators decided that Ham shot himself in the foot by relying on the bible, but admitting that his beliefs will never change:</p>

<p>Ken Ham admitted that creationism was not a scientific position by conceding that it had never made any predictions about the natural world, and it isn&#8217;t falsifiable. 92% of respondents on a <a href="http://www.christiantoday.com/article/bill.nye.vs.ken.ham.debate.live.stream.free.watch.online.creation.vs.evolution.debate.here.start.time/35688.htm">poll in ChristianityToday</a> thought that Bill Nye won the debate, and Pat Robertson said that the idea that &#8220;it all came about in 6,000 years is nonsense&#8221; and &#8220;let&#8217;s not make a joke of ourselves&#8221;</p>

</div>


<p>Slate notes that HBO is airing a documentary about the <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/02/creationism_is_dangerous_hbo_documentary_questioning_darwin_shows_how_fundamentalism.html">rise of creationism in America</a>, with the following quote from a pastor:</p>

<blockquote><p>“If somewhere in the Bible I were to find a passage that says two plus two equals five,” the pastor states plainly, “I wouldn’t question what I’m reading in the Bible. I would believe it—accept it as true and then do my best to work it out and to understand it.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The problem is that the bible asks belivers to think that pi is 3 in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+7%3A23&amp;version=KJV">1 Kings</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>And he made a molten sea, <strong>ten cubits</strong> from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of <strong>thirty cubits did compass it</strong> round about.</p></blockquote>

<p>Biblical literalists have a range of bogus explanations for why these numbers are true, without embracing the idea that mathematics is wrong. We don&#8217;t call someone a theistic mathematician if they believe in the accuracy of pi, or a theistic meteorologist if they believe rain comes from clouds rather than storehouses in heaven. The mythical beasts that were included in the King James Bible, like <a href="http://classic.net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=Satyr">Satyrs</a>, <a href="http://classic.net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=unicorn">Unicorns</a> and <a href="http://classic.net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=cockatrice">Cockatrices</a> have mostly been retranslated in modern bibles. It was said in relation to the Nephilim that &#8221;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_Giant">There&#8217;s a sucker born every minute</a>&#8221; and most people find the mythical creatures laughable:</p>

<p><img src="http://nsewell.com//images/bible-dinosaur.jpg"></p>

<p>Other than the occasional <a href="http://galileowaswrong.com/">hick</a>, nobody challenges the heliocentric model, and the flat earth society seems to have fallen over the edge of the disc. Other than <a href="http://nsewell.com//blog/2013/10/12/plait-spherist/">Phil Plait</a>, nobody decries the spherist bias in the media. Evolution is one of the only areas where children are encouraged to disrupt their science classes, and United States legislatures are trying to encourage the teaching of nonsense. Creationists have managed to get <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/02/09/the_scary_future_of_creationism_in_america/">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> in federal funding in Australia to persue their secterian agenda, and are set to introduce creationism as an &#8220;alternate perspective&#8221; into the history curriculum during the national curriculum review.</p>

<p>Bill Nye&#8217;s biggest appeal in his debate was that for Western countries to be globally competitive in the 21st century, we need to empower science educators to give children a love of learning that will prepare them to be innovators in the rapidly changing technology sector. Religiously and politically motivated campaigns instead want to cast doubt about scientific consensus on topics like evolution and climate change, and are well financed to do so. Anyone with a love of science needs to fight the underhanded campaigns that are trying undermine science education in school classrooms.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Youth Perspectives on Tech in Schools: From Mobile Devices to Restrictions and Monitoring]]></title>
    <link href="http://nsewell.com//blog/2014/02/10/ict-school/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-10T00:09:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://nsewell.com//blog/2014/02/10/ict-school</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Interesting report on <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2378590">SSRN</a> on the use of tech in schoos, and the youth perspectives on network restrictions and monitoring. Students expressed frustration at the top down focus on technology; &#8220;while many participants reported positive feelings around the current state of technology in their schools, some students seemed frustrated about ongoing initiatives to provide them with tablets for academic purposes. Several participants stated that they would have preferred new laptops to new tablets.&#8221; Some students expressed frustration at inequalities between the ICT resources of different schools.</p>

<p>78% of young people now have a cell phone, and almost <a href="http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Teens-and-Tech.aspx">half (47%) of those own smartphones</a>. A large number of students refuse to hand in their devices, even though they don&#8217;t plan to use them in school hours. A number of students felt frustrated at the disconnect between ICT policy and the concept of the school trusting their students. Some students use Wifi networks from neighbouring buildings because of speed constraints, and blocking of websites that have information on news topics like rapes in India. The schools need to follow Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) guidelines, which don&#8217;t include the blocking of social media sites, even though most schools include it. More public schools than private schools block sites like youtube, which has both &#8220;distracting&#8221; and objectionable content, as well as educational content. Some students found that blocking Facebook blocked educational sites like Khan Academy that use OAuth to login. Students that saved homework on personal email accounts weren&#8217;t able to access them from some school networks.</p>

<p>37% of students admit to bypassing filtering themselves, with simple workarounds like SSL/TLS sites allowed. Some students use VPNs on their own devices. Blocking encrypted tunneling is beyond most school ICT administrators, and there&#8217;s a growing recognition that censorship in institutions like public libraries <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/09/cost-censorship-libraries-10-years-under-childrens-internet-protection-act">is ineffective and curtails free speech</a>. In a telling statement, one student reveals that teachers sometimes ask their students how to bypass filters.</p>

<p>One of the most problematic issues in the paper is the privacy issue. Schools have legitimate reasons to use screen sharing tools to prevent disruptive behaviour, but this also gives teachers mostly unaccountable access to record private student communications. Most of the privacy protections are in school policy, rather than in the technology itself.</p>

<p>Students have a range of legitimate reasons to bypass censorship, and legitimate concerns around their own privacy. Schools have opened up as a new front in the classic war of <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/23/civilwar.html">users vs owners</a>. The shift from from centrally controlled mainframes to user centric PC&#8217;s brought a raft of security issues before <em>some</em> smartphone and tablet vendors moved to a walled garden approach.</p>

<p>ITU figures show that mobile broadband subscriptions are one of the fastest growing sectors in telecomms:</p>

<div class="figure"><a href="http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2013-e.pdf"><img src="http://nsewell.com//images/itu-2013.png" link="http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2013-e.pdf"><p></span></a></div>


<p>It seems like the only way to be sure that your kid is getting the full educational benefit of the internet without being monitored is to buy them a mobile broadband subscription and send them to a private school. And then ask yourself why on earth we have a digital divide.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The curiosity rover has shot an image of the sky in mars, with Earth appearing as a <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/07/curiosity_sends_back_pale_blue_dot_picture_of_earth_from_mars/">tiny speck of light</a>
<img src="http://nsewell.com//images/pale-blue-dot-mars.jpg"></p>

<p>When you hear about <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2014/02/06/an-open-letter-to-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-a-young-stranger-six-thousand-miles-and-a-dozen-years-away-2/">four year olds vowing to slaughter their enemies</a> in a war that has claimed the lives of <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-06/102c000-children-killed-in-syrian-civil-war3a-un-report/5241448">10,000 children</a> think about how great the bloodshed is over control of such a tiny fraction of such a small planet. Shane Smith <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOndtUcRXdU&amp;list=PLw613M86o5o5BNP8ls1TNDLLHVEi1Mopg&amp;t=11m18s">notes</a> that at the same time as people are looking at the surface of mars on their smartphones, uneducated Afghan boys are being used in suicide attacks against civilians on Muslim holy days.</p>

<p>It brings to mind one of Carl Sagan&#8217;s most <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9TIeuBF9Ss">famous speeches</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Look again at that dot. That&#8217;s here. That&#8217;s home. That&#8217;s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every &#8220;superstar,&#8221; every &#8220;supreme leader,&#8221; every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</p>

<p>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.</p>

<p>Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.</p>

<p>The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.</p>

<p>It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we&#8217;ve ever known.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Callum Southerland&#8217;s long version of the film is worth watching:</p>

    <id>http://nsewell.com//blog/2014/02/07/positivism</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Consider this: your colleague David has been running late to work and needs to buy a new alarm clock. He goes to a clock shop with 100 clocks to find one to buy, but upon inspecting the clocks, he finds that some disagree with each other. About 3% of the clocks have a major discrepancy with the other clocks. Which is a reasonable conclusion?</p>

<ol>
<li>David decides to buy a clock, and trusts that it can tell the time accurately enough</li>
<li>David decides to go to another shop that will have better clocks</li>
<li>David decides not to buy a clock, not trusting the accuracy of any clocks he could buy</li>
<li>David confirms his suspicion that time cannot be measured by anyone (which he had deduced from his study of ancient poetry that describe the gods as making time as a stream that ebbs and flows), and laments the number of poor children duped by the pro-temporalist bias in the media and the public schooling system, that have conspired to push dissenting voices out of the public sphere because of corporate interests and the academic pride of liberal elites in their ivory towers at so-called ivy league universities.</li>
</ol>


<p>I think we all understand that 4 is not a reasonable position, but sophists have for centuries tried to confuse the public by describing scientific uncertainty and scientific doubt as the same thing. I mention the example of clocks because Bill Nye used it as an example of scientific uncertainty in his debate with the young earth creationist Ken Ham. Ham claims that discrepancies between certain forms of radiometric dating mean that nobody can have any trust that the earth is more than 10,000 years old, which is his <em>a priori</em> conclusion derived from selective interpretation of a modern translation of an ancient Hebrew religious text. Nye&#8217;s example is a good one, because nobody objects to the conclusion that time is measurable, and so nobody tries to use the tricks that creationists and flat-earthers will use when discussing science.</p>

<p>In 1864 the founder of the Flat Earth Society, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Rowbotham">Dr Parallax</a>, was finally challenged to perform a public experiment to test his claim of a flat earth. An astronomer predicted that because of the curvature of the earth, only the lantern of a distant lighthouse would be visible. The effect of the curvature of the earth was greater than what the astronomer had predicted, and Parallax observed only half the lantern of the lighthouse, leading him to claim that he won the experiment. The example of Parallax shows the clear danger of an uncharismatic scientist unable to cope with a charlatan.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s very easy to spin certain soundbites in a way that a scientifically illiterate audience won&#8217;t understand. Consider, for instance, the cooling periods that can be found by cherry picking the regions of <a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/graphics.php?g=47">analysis in global temperatures</a>:
<img src="http://nsewell.com//images/climate-skepticalscience.jpg"></p>

<p>Scientists need to be careful in a world of soundbites that they aren&#8217;t completely misrepretented by charlatans. As Carl Sagan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8HEwO-2L4w">said</a> &#8220;if we are not able to ask skeptical questions, to interrogate those who tell us that something is true, to be skeptical of those in authority, then we&#8217;re up for grabs, for the next charlatan, political or religious who comes ambling along.&#8221; Unfortunately, with weak scientific education and a media that present false balance, it can be hard for sicentists to demonstrate the <a href="http://skepticalscience.com/Debunking-climate-myths-two-contrasting-case-studies.html">consensus they have on issues</a>. On climate issues, NASA and the NOAA are putting more effort into <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/NOAA_NASA_2013_Global_Temperatures_Joint_Briefing.pdf">publishing information themselves</a>.</p>

    <link href="http://nsewell.com//blog/2014/02/04/morrison/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-04T18:57:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://nsewell.com//blog/2014/02/04/morrison</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dr Marrion Maddox spoke about the <a href="http://www.saintdavids.org.nz/FergusonLectureJune2006.pdf">rise of Christian fundamentalism in Australian politics</a> in 2006:</p>

<blockquote><p>Christian parties have existed in Australia for a long time, but, due to the robust two- party system, have seldom had much direct electoral influence18. The Christian Democratic Party (CDP) and its predecessor (Call to Australia) have been represented in the New South Wales upper house since 1981, but enjoyed their sole, fleeting federal presence for a few months in 1998.</p>

<p>The big news story of the 2004 federal election was the national launch of Adelaide- based minor party Family First (FFP). With one member already in the South Australian upper house, FFP ran federal candidates all over Australia. Despite a small primary vote, elaborate preference deals meant that the party had one Senator elected, Victorian Steve Fielding. Most of the candidates were members of one denomination, the Assemblies of God. Others, such as Fielding, came from related Pentecostal traditions. A few identified with other traditions, such as Catholic. Despite these connections, the party emphatically portrayed itself as a ‘family values’ party, rejecting suggestions that it is a ‘Christian party’. Party events sometimes resemble church functions, and vice versa20, but the party’s website scrupulously avoids religious references, leading even other Christian parties to allege duplicity on FFP’s part21. The media image of FFP as a Christian party has persisted, despite official denials. For example, on the Sunday morning after the election, when it appeared FFP might have the balance of power in the Senate, veteran television journalist Laurie Oakes proposed that FFP’s success marked ‘the arrival of the religious right in Australian politics’.</p>

<p>However, despite the huge media fascination it generated, FFP was only ever a sideshow in Australian religious right politics. Far more significant was the positioning of the Liberal Party increasingly towards the religious right, which, as I document in detail in my book God Under Howard: The Rise of the Religious Right in Australian Politics23 , had been underway since the formation of the federal Liberal Party’s socially conservative, ambiguously-Christian Lyons Forum pressure group in the early 1990s.  Religious priming (known journalistically as the ‘dog-whistle’ strategy) reached its peak in the lead-up to the 2004 campaign.</p>

<p>Here, too, the Assemblies of God featured prominently. While Adelaide’s Paradise Church was the launching pad for FFP, its Sydney counterpart, Hillsong, became associated with the Liberal Party. Not only did John Howard, his Liberal deputy Peter Costello and other senior Liberals address the church, but Hillsong has claimed Liberal Member for Mitchell Alan Cadman, Young Liberals president Alex Hawke and former NSW Liberal Party director Scott Morrison as members.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nick Bryant notes that Morrison was mentored by Brian Houston himself, which is where he <a href="http://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2012/february/1328593883/nick-bryant/so-who-bloody-hell-are-you">bases his ethical foundation</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Morrison is now a Pentecostal and thus part of the most rapidly growing denomination in the land. He worships at an American-style mega-church called Shirelive in his constituency, where the gospel of prosperity is preached in an auditorium that can accommodate over 1000 evangelicals. With its water baptisms and designer-shirt pastors, Shirelive has close ties with the better-known Hillsong community. The founder of Hillsong, Harley Davidson–riding pastor Brian Houston, is one of Morrison’s mentors. In Who’s Who Morrison lists the church as his number one hobby, and his maiden speech reads in part like a personal testimony delivered on the last night of a church retreat. It included passages from Jeremiah and also the Book of Joel: “Your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions.”</p>

<p>A test of his faith came during the period when he and his wife were trying to start a family. It involved repeated courses of IVF treatment and “14 years of bitter disappointments”, but Scott and Jenny were buoyed by their sense of the providential. “God remembered her faithfulness,” recalled Morrison during his maiden speech, as he paid tribute to his wife, “and blessed us with our miracle child, Abbey Rose.” The couple now have two daughters.</p>

<p>While his faith animates his politics, he is on the record as saying “the Bible is not a policy handbook, and I get very worried when people try to treat it like one”. Critics would say that is self-evident from his heartless response to asylum seekers. “I wonder how you can claim to be a serious Christian and take these positions,” said one former colleague. Supporters, however, claim he has pursued a faith-based policy. “He’s a very ethical and moral man,” says a fellow Liberal. “Stopping the boats is ethical and moral.” In his response to December’s boat people tragedy off Java, he advocated a ‘tough love’ policy, which he claimed had the safety of boat people at its heart. After all, for Morrison the Pacific Solution was not only efficient but righteous since it crushed the evil of people smuggling. Church friends might even have seen shades of Wilberforce in his efforts to eradicate such a nefarious trade. To his critics, however, his attacks on the government, which resumed 48 hours after the overloaded boat capsized, offered yet more proof of his harrying opportunism: this was more about political point-scoring than finding a workable solution.</p></blockquote>

</a>
<div class="video-info" >Thanks to http://www.crocosauruscove.com in Darwin, Australia. You&#8217;re able to feed, handle, and swim with crocodiles. This is part of the feeding using a fishing rod. Quite a unique experience. - As you can see they jump pretty high out the water. I didn&#8217;t know they could actually jump completely out of water.

Filming these animals in slow motion is just beautiful. Something you rarely see.

On a technical side of things.

This was all filmed using a Sony fs700 with a 18-200mm 3.5-5f lens. Shot at 480 frames a second. I borrowed the camera from Sony in Hong Kong to test, and  honestly I love it so much. You can capture such amazing detail in slow motion. If you&#8217;re going to shoot slow motion it&#8217;s the cheapest camera for an indie cinematographer. 

I wasn&#8217;t paid to say any of this, Sony just wanted some footage. Maybe I&#8217;ll buy the camera soon.

    <updated>2014-01-30T01:44:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://nsewell.com//blog/2014/01/30/gerson</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jessica Ainscough is working though a list of patsies, finding her way
into being reported (with the barest of skepticism) by the <a href="http://www.donotlink.com/dd9">Sydney Morning Herald</a>. I wrote about her
unfortunate dependance on quackery in
<a href="http://nsewell.com//blog/2013/06/24/coffee-enema/">June</a>, and her <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2013/10/17/sharyn-ainscough-dies-tragically-because-she-followed-the-example-of-her-daughter-the-wellness-warrior/">mother has since passed away</a>.
Orac notes that as Ainscough’s mother was dying, she claimed that the
tumours were “healing reactions” and there was an underlying “copper
toxicity” supposedly treatable with chelation therapy:</p>

<blockquote><p>How many times have we heard cancer quacks say this, that the cancer
is not the problem but rather a “symptom” of the “real” problem or a
“protective reaction” to the real problem?</p></blockquote>

<p>As I noted in June, Ainscough invented “psychic pollution”</p>

<blockquote><p>our negative thoughts also contribute to pollution on our planet. This
is called ‘psychic pollution.’ This fact has been proven: what we
think and feel has a direct impact on the world around us</p></blockquote>

<p>There are many benefits to encouraging cancer patients to seek
professional counselling services when dealing with the side effects of
radiation and chemotherapy, as well as depression resulting from their
diagnosis. Unfortunately, many quacks try to adopt the language of
pop-psychology and tell people with terminal cancer that their
depression is the <em>cause</em> of their terminal condition, and they need to
force themselves to think positively in order to be cured. Not only will
terminal patients go to the grabe believing that they have some
spiritual or mental deficiency that causes their condition, but quacks
are given an easy excuse for the failures of treatments on patients
believed to be too “weak” or “faithless”.</p>

    <updated>2014-01-28T04:36:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://nsewell.com//blog/2014/01/28/media-manipulation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords, a large number of left
leaning media outlets criticised the right wing media’s hype and
extremism. Dan Lyons took <a href="http://www.fakesteve.net/2011/01/my-talk-with-a-left-wing-hack.html">them to task</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The problem began when news became tied to profits. The networks at
one time used to run news as a loss leader, subsidized by
entertainment. When that changed, and news started chasing ratings
(and dollars), the problem began. When dollars started to dry up,
things only got worse. Networks became desperate and resorted to
making the news more like entertainment.</p>

<p>The Internet made things worse, in two ways. First, the Internet
exacerbated the decline in revenues, and heightened the desperation in
the news business. Trust me, I’m in a position to know, because I’m in
the business of seeing just how far I can make news people bend in
order to keep getting my advertising dollars. That influence is
stronger now than it has ever been. The TV networks and magazines and
newspapers are desperate and terrified. Stuff that 10 years ago they
would have thrown back in our face they now do willingly — in fact,
they don’t even wait for us to suggest it. They suggest it themselves.</p>

<p>But second, and more important, the Internet created an outlet for
competing and often crazy voices. It gave birth to a new kind of
“news.” Despite what the new-media pundits claim, the much-celebrated
“citizen journalism” was all too often just noisy crap and propaganda.</p></blockquote>

<p>Most of the news is written by interns that only get hired if they drive
enough clicks to their linkbait articles:</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s garbage precisely because online news sites are not primarily
created to report news. They’re created to make money. Problem is,
it’s nearly impossible to make money doing what they do. So they
resort to ever more desperate tricks.</p>

<p>Why is so much online “news” reported in slideshow format? To gin up
clicks. Not because it is a better way to consume news, because,
please. Why is HuffPo so crowded with sensationalistic tabloid junk
about celebrity boobs and fluffy “lists” of “the deadliest ice
creams.” (And just about everyone else, too. )</p></blockquote>

<p>Ryan Holiday gave a keynote at TNW about how bad glorified blog
journalism is, and how easy it is to exploit media into running
“controversial” linkbait stories, like Sasha Grey in an American Apparel
ad campaign.</p>

    <link href="http://nsewell.com//blog/2014/01/28/technoutopianism/"/>
    <updated>2014-01-28T01:36:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://nsewell.com//blog/2014/01/28/technoutopianism</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was going to write a post on Ivy League universities backing Massive
Open Online Courses though edX and other providers, and started thinking
back to the discussion of the OLPC project in 2007. Widespread media
coverage showed Kofi Annan holding a prototype laptop with a hand crank
and repeated the claim that the device would eventually be available for
$100. The hand crank and the $100 price tag were unachievable, and major
glitches in the first version of the laptops dampened the hype
surrounding the project.</p>

<p>Vaclav Smil, professor emeritus of environment and geography at the
University of Manitoba commented on the media’s tendency to see technology as a <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/11/vaclav-smil-wired/">magic solution to intractable problems</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>So the answers are not technological but political: better economic
policies, better education, better trade policies.</strong></p>

<p>Right. Today, as you know, everything is “innovation.” We have
problems, and people are looking for fairy-tale solutions—innovation
like manna from heaven falling on the Israelites and saving them from
the desert. It’s like, “Let’s not reform the education system, the tax
system. Let’s not improve our dysfunctional government. Just wait for
this innovation manna from a little group of people in Silicon Valley,
preferably of Indian origin.”</p>

<p>You people at WIRED—you’re the guilty ones! You support these people,
you write about them, you elevate them onto the cover! You really
messed it up. I tell you, you pushed this on the American public,
right? And people believe it now.</p></blockquote>

<p>Smil notes that the idea of efficiency gains in every sector is “Moore’s
curse”</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>You call this Moore’s curse—the idea that if we’re innovative
enough, everything can have yearly efficiency gains.</strong></p>

<p>It’s a categorical mistake. You just cannot increase the efficiency of
power plants like that. You have your combustion machines—the best one
in the lab now is about 40 percent efficient. In the field they’re
about 15 or 20 percent efficient. Well, you can’t quintuple it,
because that would be 100 percent efficient. Impossible, right? There
are limits. It’s not a microchip.</p>

<p>The same thing is true in agriculture. You cannot increase the
efficiency of photosynthesis. We improve the performance of farms by
irrigating them and fertilizing them to provide all these nutrients.
But we cannot keep on doubling the yield every two years. Moore’s law
doesn’t apply to plants.</p></blockquote>

<p>Benjamin Bratton made similar talks in a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/30/we-need-to-talk-about-ted">TEDx talk about technological utopianism overlooking the difficult problems in philosophy and economics</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The key rhetorical device for TED talks is a combination of epiphany
and personal testimony (an “epiphimony” if you like ) through which
the speaker shares a personal journey of insight and realisation, its
triumphs and tribulations.</p>

<p>What is it that the TED audience hopes to get from this? A vicarious
insight, a fleeting moment of wonder, an inkling that maybe it’s all
going to work out after all? A spiritual buzz?</p>

<p>I’m sorry but this fails to meet the challenges that we are supposedly
here to confront. These are complicated and difficult and are not
given to tidy just-so solutions. They don’t care about anyone’s
experience of optimism. Given the stakes, making our best and
brightest waste their time – and the audience’s time – dancing like
infomercial hosts is too high a price. It is cynical.</p>

<p>Also, it just doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Recently there was a bit of a dust up when TEDGlobal sent out a note
to TEDx organisers asking them not to not book speakers whose work
spans the paranormal, the conspiratorial, new age “quantum
neuroenergy”, etc: what is called woo. Instead of these placebos, TEDx
should instead curate talks that are imaginative but grounded in
reality. In fairness, they took some heat, so their gesture should be
acknowledged. A lot of people take TED very seriously, and might lend
credence to specious ideas if stamped with TED credentials. “No” to
placebo science and medicine.</p>

<p>But … the corollaries of placebo science and placebo medicine are
placebo politics and placebo innovation. On this point, TED has a long
way to go.</p>

<p>Perhaps the pinnacle of placebo politics and innovation was featured
at TEDx San Diego in 2011. You’re familiar I assume with Kony2012, the
social media campaign to stop war crimes in central Africa? So what
happened here? Evangelical surfer bro goes to help kids in Africa. He
makes a campy video explaining genocide to the cast of Glee. The world
finds his public epiphany to be shallow to the point of self-delusion.
The complex geopolitics of central Africa are left undisturbed. Kony’s
still there. The end.</p>

<p>You see, when inspiration becomes manipulation, inspiration becomes
obfuscation. If you are not cynical you should be sceptical. You
should be as sceptical of placebo politics as you are placebo
medicine.</p></blockquote>

the rising number of vaccine preventable diseases in first world
contries. After Andrew Wakefield took out a <a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/vaccine-patent.htm">patent on a single Measels vaccine</a> he falsified a study that appeared to show that appeared to show that the Measels, Mumps and Rubella triple antigen was unsafe for children, proposing his own patented vaccine as a “safer” alternative. Even after Wakefield’s paper has been retracted for innacuracy, and he was struck off the medical register for <a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr-lancet.htm">“dishonest”, “unethical” and “callous”</a> behaviour, anti-vaccine hysteria continues to spread thoughout the world. The drop in MMR vaccination rates in Wales to below 80% has caused a widespread measels outbreak, leaving parents of infected teenagers feeling betrayed by the lies of the anti-vaccine movement:</p>

</a>
<div class="video-info" >Australian ABC Lateline programme looks at the early-2013 outbreak of measles in Wales UK. 
A recent measles fatality is likely linked to the Andrew Wakefield MMR fraud which led to a baseless reduction in uptake of the MMR vaccine. It&#8217;s apparent that now fear of the demonstrable harm of measles outweighs the fallacious fear of MMR.

<p>Australian ABC Lateline programme looks at the early-2013 outbreak of
measles in Wales UK. A recent measles fatality is likely linked to the
Andrew Wakefield MMR fraud which led to a baseless reduction in uptake
of the MMR vaccine. It’s apparent that now fear of the demonstrable harm
of measles outweighs the fallacious fear of MMR. Notifications equal 800
since November 2012 - approximately 7 times that for the entire year of
2012. The vast majority of parents now accept that the “callous” and
deregistered Wakefield is a charlatan and a fraud.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Wakefield is only the latest in a long line of cranks
opposed to the vaccination of children. I recently came across a talk by <a href="http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/from-jenner-to-wakefield-the-long-shadow-of-the-anti-vaccination-movement">Professor Gareth Williams</a>
on the history of the anti-vaccine movement, going right back to Jenner
himself. Some doctors opposed cowpox vaccination as smallpox cases were
a large portion of their business, but most interestingly many people found religious arguments against vaccination. Theologians in France and England argued that ”<a href="http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/whitem10.html">diseases are sent by Providence for the punishment of sin</a>” and suggested that
Job’s <a href="https://net.bible.org/#!bible/Job+2:4">boils and ulcers</a> were a
result of cowpox vaccination by Satan. One of the most wacko opponents of the Jennerian society wrote that smallpox helped to <a href="http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/6059511?n=32&amp;imagesize=1200&amp;jp2Res=.25&amp;printThumbnails=no">lower the size of poor families</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>why is it not remembered that in the populous parts of the Metropolis,
where the abundance of children exceed the means of providing food,
and raiment for them, this pestilential disease is considered as a
merciful provision on the part of Providence, to lessen the burthen of
a poor man’s family ?</p></blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, while most doctors (Wakefield excluded) would never seek
to harm their patients to increase their own business, many pastors
coninue to teach that children should not be vaccinated against
infectious diseases. Measels outbreaks have been observed in areas with
low vaccination rates, commonly correlated with <a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/09/vaccines-undermine-divine-providence/">high numbers of evangelical megachurches</a>.  Unfortunately, a number of churches order their congregation to eschew medical treatment in favour of prayer, which <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/01/17/idaho-republican-opposes-law-aimed-at-stopping-faith-healing-child-deaths/">Republican lawmakers protect as “religious freedom”</a>, even after a spate of preventable deaths.</p>

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)</div>

<p>A few great points
* Inverting William Gibson&#8217;s view: &#8220;The future is here, and it <strong>is</strong> widely distributed&#8221;
* There is a global shift in power from the West to the East, and from traditional centralised power structures to users.
* The ability to see different perspectives over the same medium challenges the idea of a single source of truth.
* The freedom of the users comes directly from the freedom of the tools they use.
* Technologists have the abilitiy to route around a damaged system, but they have a moral responsibility to represent those that can&#8217;t.
* Internet users are among only a third of the world, and so every internet user has the power to effect the world in positive ways.
* Pia on Hipsters: Billie Brag quote &#8220;Cynicism is the perfect enemy of progress.&#8221;
* If we don&#8217;t work to shape the future, someone else is going to shape it for us.
* The future is not just being determned in traditional ways.</p>

    <id>http://nsewell.com//blog/2014/01/07/gmo-pseudoscience</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There’s a great article in the New York Times about how politicians and

It links to a great graph from boingboing pointing out the fallacy of
<a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/01/01/correlation-between-autism-dia.html">confusing corellation with causation</a>:</p>

<p>Science Magazine is one of the bastions of reason, with Nobel lauriets
signing an open letter denouncing the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6152/1320.full">destruction of test
crops</a></p>

<blockquote><p>New technologies often evoke rumors of hazard. These generally fade
with time when, as in this case, no real hazards emerge. But the
anti-GMO fever still burns brightly, fanned by electronic gossip and
well-organized fear-mongering that profits some individuals and
organizations. We, and the thousands of other scientists who have
signed the statement of protest, stand together in staunch opposition
to the violent destruction of required tests on valuable advances such
as Golden Rice that have the potential to save millions of
impoverished fellow humans from needless suffering and death.</p></blockquote>

Does Christianity or secular humanism provide a better foundation for civil society? That is the question that is going to addressed between two scholars, Dr. David Marshall and Dr. Phillip Zuckerman, a Christian and an atheist.

David Marshall is the founder and director of the Kuai Mu Institute for Christianity and World Cultures, and the author of four books, including The Truth Behind the New Atheism: Responding to the Emerging Challenges to God and Christianity (Harvest House Publishers).

Phil Zuckerman is a professor of sociology and secular studies at Pitzer College in Claremont, CA. He is the author most recently of Faith No More: Why People Reject Religion (Oxford University Press, 2011) and Society Without God (NYU Press, 2008).</div>
</div>


<p>Zuckerman stuck to the facts about why largely secular post-Chrsitian societies around the world are doing better on most indicators than the most religious societies, while Marshall presented weak anecdotes of individual conversion experiences and straw men about how communists and vikings are bad people. The pastor of the church said &#8220;It just didn&#8217;t go the way we wanted it to go. We were not represented well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zuckerman has noted that many European societies that score well on social indicators also have <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/170356660/Phil-Zuckerman">low rates of Chrsitian belief</a>. Only 18% of Swedes believe in heaven, 10% believe in hell and 3% believe that the Bible is the literal word of God, among the lowest rates in the world. In Denmark, women&#8217;s labour force participation doubled in the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s, rapidly changing the model of femininity valued by young women. Social changes like these supported by neoliberal governments, including the banning of prosletyzing in schools, and the provision of free healthcare to all have quickly caused generational decline in religion as the state Lutheran church struggles to market itself.</p>

<p>Zuckerman eloquently criticised the bible belt states for high rates of divorce, teen pregnancy, sexual assault, diabetes, child abuse, unemployment and murder. He has a long history of criticising the political hypocrisy of the white evangelical power base, that claims evolution is wrong, but <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/phil-zuckerman/why-evangelicals-hate-jes_b_830237.html">tend to support policies that could be described as &#8220;Social Darwinism.&#8221;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>The results from a recent poll <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/Politics-and-Elections/Tea-Party-and-Religion.aspx">published by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life</a> reveal what social scientists have known for a long time: White Evangelical Christians are the group least likely to support politicians or policies that reflect the actual teachings of Jesus.</p></blockquote>

<p>Zuckerman has an excellent analysis of the <a href="http://www.edge.org/conversation/why-the-gods-are-not-winning">global decline of faith</a> on Edge.org. One interesting fact about the general decline of Chrstianity in America is how gender plays a factor in mixed faith households:</p>

<blockquote><p>Rather than Amerofaith becoming deeply patriarchal as Longman thinks, it is increasingly feminine. Women church goers greatly outnumber men, who find church too dull. Here&#8217;s the kicker. Children tend to pick up their beliefs from their fathers. So, despite a vibrant evangelical youth cohort, young Americans taken as a whole are the least religious and most culturally tolerant age group in the nation.</p></blockquote>

<p>He notes that the well resourced churches are consolidating believers rather than expanding the faithful</p>

<blockquote><p>Even the megachurch phenomenon is illusory. A spiritual cross of sports stadiums with theme parks, hi-tech churches are a desperate effort to pull in and satisfy a mass-media jaded audience for whom the old sit in the pews and listen to the standard sermon and sing some old time hymns does not cut it anymore. Rather than boosting church membership, megachurches are merely consolidating it.</p></blockquote>

<p>While Zuckerman notes that he was well remunerated for travelling to take part in the professionally recorded debate, the decision of the church to initially refuse to publish the video demonstrates that content matters more than its presentation. The trend of religion being on the nose for the last hundred years will continue as churches struggle to cover up their mistakes in an age of social media, no matter how well they learn to speak with &#8216;Gen Y&#8217;.</p>

    <link href="http://nsewell.com//blog/2013/10/25/bishop-bling/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-25T09:27:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://nsewell.com//blog/2013/10/25/bishop-bling</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The pope has <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-23/pope-banishes-germany27s-bling-bishop-from-diocese/5041880">banished the &#8220;Bishop of Bling&#8221;</a> Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst over allegations of lying.</p>

<p>Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst announced that his diocean centre would cost 5.5 million euros in 2010, but the architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz-Peter_Tebartz-van_Elst">admitted that the true cost was known to be much higher from the start</a>, with plans for extravagant addons like half a million euros for art and 20,000 for a bathtub causing the project to blow out to 32 million euros. This came at a time when his staff were facing funding cuts because of a savings plan instituted a principle of austerity in the church.</p>

<p>The pope has <a href="http://michaeloloughlin.religionnews.com/2013/10/23/popes-financial-reforms/">instituted financial reforms</a> in the Vatican to encourage transparency and accountability, and to prevent money laundering. German dioceses are chafing under the new plans, which would reveal to their donors just how well-off they are.</p>

<p>As reported in the Religion News Service, German dioceses are among the world&#8217;s welthiest, and the diocese of Cologne is <a href="http://www.religionnews.com/2013/10/23/bishops-suspension-symptom-german-catholic-churchs-wealth/">richer than the Vatican</a>. By law, Germans registered as Catholics must give 8-10% of their tax revenue to the church, which gave the church $7.1 US billion in 2012. Even as over 100,000 members leave the church every year following child sex abuse scandals, the dioceses still have enormous asset reserves.</p>

<p>While the new Argentinian pope travells on a bus or in a donated 20 year old Renault his obstinate German subordinantes refuse to give up their BMWs and Audis. The previous pope took up a yearly collection of <a href="https://opentabernacle.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/popes-personal-income-200-million-annually/">$200 million US</a>, which will certainly guarantee him a comfortable life in retirement, while the new pope has opted to live in a single room in a guesthouse rather than his papal apartment.</p>

<blockquote><p>“The German Catholic Church is one of the country’s wealthiest and largest organizations and its top officials expect a certain lifestyle,” said Carsten Frerk, who has published two books on the German churches’ wealth and what he describes as their opaque financing. “But they are wary of the extent of their wealth becoming broadly known because it might lead to fewer donations.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Francis has commented that he <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/01/pope-francis-interview_n_4023659.html?utm_hp_ref=religion">dislikes careerist priests</a>, stating “It also happens to me that when I meet a clericalist, I suddenly become anti-clerical. Clericalism should not have anything to do with Christianity.”</p>

<p>Francis had stated in September that the Catholic Church was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24166434">too focussed on sexual issues</a> like homosexuality, abortion and contraception, and they must increase their focus on the poor and marginalised. This has apparently had little effect in the US, where the US Conference of Catholic Bishops <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/10/18/1248662/-Shutdown-losers-include-Catholic-Bishops">campaigned for Republicans to introduce religious priviliges</a> into the &#8216;must pass&#8217; resolution to end the government shutdown and avert a US government default. The shutdown cost 800,000 jobs and left poor families without food stamps for weeks, and resulted in the Republican party hitting the lowest approval rating of any political party recorded by Gallup. The government shutdown over Obamacare appears to be a <a href="http://thecontributor.com/religion/how-catholic-bishops-pushed-shutdown-%E2%80%93-and-even-default-%E2%80%93-over-birth-control">long-planned offensive from the USCCB</a>, with their opposition to Obamacare <a href="http://publicreligion.org/2012/08/as-catholics-go-so-goes-the-nation/">parroted by the Romney campaign</a>.</p>

<p>In Victoria, local communities are devastated that the Uniting Church is selling off between <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-17/730-anglican-church-story/5029694">$32 million</a> and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-11/uniting-church-puts-properties-up-for-sale-to-clear-debts/5015754">$100 million</a> worth of church properties to cover debts accumulated by the failure of Acacia College. The Church is considering selling <a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/north/ivanhoe-east-church-on-the-market-as-uniting-church-liquidates-properties/story-fnglenug-1226741089815">56 properties</a> after they had had run up $10 million dollars in debt because of legal issues with the developer, and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-10-18/catholic-church-considers-buying-acacia-college/4321504">unexpected infrastructure costs</a>.</p>

<p>While megachurches like Hillsong make <a href="www.heraldsun.com.au/money/money-matters/tax-office-push-for-charity-monitoring/story-fn312ws8-1225896551630">over $50 million dollars a year in tax-free profits</a>, paying their leaders more than $1.5 million a year, most small churches founded on volunteerism and support for charities have their supporter base dying off, with none of the flashy showmanship that attracts rich idiots into the Pentecostal churches.</p>

<p>Many of the parishioners were shocked to find that the churches they had been volunteering in and donating to for years, and for some, decades, were soon to be sold off. This is not the first time that local churches have been asked to bear the brunt of financial losses after a central church body loses millions. The Sydney Anglican church lost over $100 million by <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/millions-wiped-out-by-church-gambles-20090609-c29m.html">borrowing money to invest in shares before the GFC in 2009</a>, leading it to ask parishioners to take part in a planned but now unfunded evangelical sabotage of the Bible Society&#8217;s Jesus All About Life campaign. In February the Los Angeles Catholic diocese, after having paid $660 million dollars to settle more than 500 child sexual abuse cases <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/deaconsbench/2013/02/los-angeles-considering-capital-campaign-to-raise-200-million/">asked their parishioners for $200 million</a> for &#8220;repair and upkeep of our parish churches and schools.&#8221; This is after they had already managed to misappropriate $115 million from a grave maintenance fund <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/wwjtd/2013/02/the-los-angeles-diocese-found-some-new-funds/">into paying off child sexual assault victims</a>, without the knowledge or consent of the donors.</p>

<p>Most religionists would be completely shocked to find that the religion they&#8217;ve been trying to follow is completely different to the religion that their leaders use to gain money and power.</p>

<h3>Wider resentment of Prosperity Theology</h3>

<p>While in Germany the revelation of lying, selfish preachers is a scandal, in the US it&#8217;s nothing new. Peter Popoff was making $4 million a year when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Popoff">James Randi exposed him as a fraud</a>, and Bobby Tilton may have made as much as $80 million a year when he was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Tilton">found to be dumping the prayer requests his ministry took donations for</a>. The new Reality TV show Preachers of LA shows the glitzy and glamorous lives of Ferrari and Bentley driving pastors who fully embrace Prosperity Theology. Bishop Ron Gibson, with whom he had a child out of wedlock, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10406467/Meet-the-real-bishops-of-bling-the-Californian-preachers-of-prosperity-theology.html">boasts that fancy cars are not just for materialistic rappers</a></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;P Diddy and Jay-Z - they&#8217;re not the only ones who should be driving Ferraris and living in large houses,&#8221; he says to the camera as he compares himself to secular celebrities. To whoops from his congregation, he notes: &#8220;You see my bling, you see my Bentley, you see my glory but you don&#8217;t see my story.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `[]&#8217; for nil:NilClass</p>

<p>Baptist Pastors have a long history of playing their parishioners for mugs. Mark Barclay, a self proclaimed &#8220;Preacher of Righteousness&#8221; recently asked his followers for $79,000 for a paint job on his private jet, saying &#8221;<a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/televangelist-asks-followers-for-79k-to-do-paint-job-on-lords-jet-he-bought-last-year-98435/">the airplane does belong to Him [God] and not me and is used for His ministry and not personal use</a>.&#8221; He had the gall to cite Jesus&#8217;s words &#8220;do not store up treasures for yourself&#8221; to justify why his members should &#8220;sow&#8221; offerings for his million dollar jet.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a growing tide of criticism of prosperity theology. In a statement, Professor Stanley Hauerwas denounced the $1.7 million home of pastor Steve Furtick saying &#8220;It&#8217;s just vulgar. It&#8217;s an offense to the Gospel.&#8221; A number of media outlets are criticising pastors with private jets in <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2220833/Laughing-private-jet--93m-pastor-accused-exploiting-British-worshippers.html">Nigeria</a> and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andersonantunes/2013/01/17/the-richest-pastors-in-brazil/">Brazil</a>. A pastor who promised parishioners a miraculous new car if they would donate $52,000 for new blades for his private helicopter has lashed out at the media for publicizing the campaign, but not before widespread denunciation.</p>
