<p>There are between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian#Demographics">38,000</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_denominations">41,000 Christian denominations</a>, more than the <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=number%20of%20sentences%20in%20the%20bible">33,829 sentences in the KJV</a>. Some of these denominations are the same movement in different countries, but the figures show a remarkable diversity of opinion not just on liturgy but on scripture and theology.</p>

<p>Protestants maintain that the only thing necessary for belief is scripture alone (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_scriptura">Sola Scriptura</a>). If this is correct, and all Catholics are in error, then why didn&#8217;t Jesus give his disciples a printing press? Or why didn&#8217;t Yahweh pop one in at the first council of Nicea in 325 CE?

    <updated>2013-04-02T11:26:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2013/04/02/damage-purity-culture</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The religious right has been using sex to sell a represive anti-sex agenda, creating the idea of soulgasms, where if Jesus is in the room, couples will have the most amazing orgasms ever, so long as they are married.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We must fight [lust] with the massive promise of superior happiness. We must swallow up the little flicker of lust’s pleasure in the conflagration of holy satisfaction.” John Piper</p></blockquote>

<p>Many Christians today don&#8217;t present Jesus as a redeemer for all people and all cultures that saves individuals into a community that will have a transformative influence on their life. Instead they present a moralising gospel of American Jesus as the functional saviour that will give someone friends, social status in the Christian subculture, and perfect sex in a perfect marriage so long as they look and sound Christian enough. Rather than empowering countercultural belief in liberation theology of Jesus&#8217;s teachings, it imposes a literalistic rule based adherance to a culture of shame, fear and intimidation of Christendom. It&#8217;s against this context that mission strategies are devised to present Christianity as the solution to singleness, rejection and loneliness.</p>

<p>This has many damaging effects on young people inculcated into the culture. It tells young adults that virginity matters more than chastity, and even if they spend 60 hours a week volunteering for charity, they have no standing in the church if they have ever had sex. It forces young women into the position of having no sexual agency, no ability to consent to sex, but all of the responsibility for &#8220;causing&#8221; lust in men.</p>

<p>Barna has polled the reasons why young adults leave the church (and many leave the faith altogether). Their <a href="http://www.barna.org/teens-next-gen-articles/528-six-reasons-young-christians-leave-church">results show six key categories for why people leave</a>, facts that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karl-giberson-phd/creationists-and-young-christians_b_1096839.html">cause consternation for some</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Churches seem overprotective.</li>
<li>Teens and 20-somethings&#8217; experience of Christianity is shallow.</li>
<li>Churches come across as antagonistic to science.</li>
<li><strong>Young Christians&#8217; church experiences related to sexuality are often simplistic, judgmental.</strong></li>
<li>They wrestle with the exclusive nature of Christianity.</li>
<li>The church feels unfriendly to those who doubt.</li>
</ol>


<p>Presenting sex inside marriage as always perfect, always effortless and always satisfying as it is in accordance with God&#8217;s design&#8221; sets young couples up for a steep learning curve. Those who can&#8217;t wait, like 70% of conservative Texan Southern Baptist couples will feel secret shame that they may not even be able to bring before a pastor if they have overstated the significance of sex in relation to other sin.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a stranger niche of homeschooled daughters going to purity balls, to leart to save their first kiss until their wedding day. Having taken the simplistic black and white answers around sex, they are now pushing out a legalistic agenda to beyond what the bible even remotely supports.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s starting to be pushback.</p>

<h3>DRISCOLL</h3>

<p>Christians starting to warm up to plain talk about sexual issues for married couples.</p>

<p>But pastors aren&#8217;t sex therapists - and you can&#8217;t always get simplistic answers to every question. The desire to have a minister explain &#8216;this is ok, this is not ok&#8217; is rooted in not wanting to understand the hermeneutic view of scripture</p>

<h3>Damage</h3>

<p>Pushing damage onto women

<p>Ezekiel 23</p>

<p>Ignorance of the size and extent of the purity culture leaves people unable to understand its real effects. Shaming female sexuality can cause <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2011/11/the-purity-culture-and-sexual-dysfunction.html">serious sexual dysfunction well into marriage</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>After a few months, I did start having sexual fantasies. But they were all fantasies of non-consensual sex. Why? Because on some intuitive level that made them safer, less taboo, and less sinful. After all, in these fantasies, I didn’t have a choice. I didn’t have sexual agency. I wasn’t choosing to have sex. I wasn’t active. It wasn’t that I wanted to fantasize about non-consensual sex; rather, as a result of the purity culture and my suppression of my sexuality, this was the only kind of sex I could fantasize about.</p>

<p>When my husband and I began having sex, we found that the only way I could orgasm was to pretend our sex was non-consensual. It was as though imagining and miming being coerced was the only way I could truly let go, detach from myself, and give myself permission to feel sexual pleasure. Being an active sexual agent, even in my thoughts, had been a no-no for so long that this suppression had become hard-wired into my brain. It literally took us years to figure out a way for me to have orgasms without pretending that our sex was non-consensual. I have nothing against people who simply enjoy this sort of sex play or this sort of fantasies, and I’m not saying it’s bad. It’s just that I really wanted to be able to experience orgasm without having to pretend sex was non-consensual.</p>

<p>It’s been some years now, and things have gotten better. I can have orgasms without pretending our sex is non-consensual, and I now have sexual fantasies in which I am an active sexual agent. There are some things I’m still working on, because these sorts of thought patterns don’t go away overnight, but I’m confident that I’m on the right path and have a bright sexual future.</p>

<p>How did this happen to me? It’s simple, really. I spent the first twenty years of my life suppressing every sexual urge, thought, or desire. I literally became essentially asexual. Literally. My sexuality was dead, because I had killed it. I had sacrificed it on the alter of the purity culture in a desire to make myself pure and godly. And yet, I’d always been taught that once I was married I would experience carefree, romping, ecstatic, incredible sex the likes of which I could not imagine. There is a disconnect here. How is one supposed to go from being sexually suppressed and extinguished to being an active and fulfilled sexual being?</p>

<p>I was taught growing up that every sexual thought or desire outside of marriage is sin. Believing this, I spent twenty years working hard to keep from thinking about sex, and I succeeded. I was essentially asexual. And then, with my husband, I was suddenly supposed to think about sex. My mind rebelled. My indoctrination of my own brain had been all too successful. My sexual dysfunction was only natural.</p></blockquote>

http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2013/03/21/the-author-of-god-and-boobs-responds-to-your-questions
http://www.cnbc.com/id/100522472
… Schuller Wyatt was scheduled to appear on the Hour of Power broadcast where her brother Robert “Bobby” Schuller III preaches. But when word got out that Schuller Wyatt had written God and Boobs, she was unceremoniously dumped via email from a church executive who gave no explanation.</p>

<p>“I’m tired of religious bullies dictating to women how we should live our lives. In my work as a pastor, I counseled too many women who felt ashamed of their sexuality and were silenced into submission. I am trying to empower them to feel good about themselves.“</p>

<blockquote><p>Spiritual leaders have been guilty of teaching women to hide their figures in dumpy clothes, to avoid thinking about sex and to ignore their sexual desires. Whether Protestant or Catholic, most religious rules about sex result in women feeling their sexuality is shameful. Women in my religious circle won’t typically admit to their friends or pastors that they’ve felt this way, but they will tell their counselors. In the privacy of a safe setting, they talk of things like having to endure looks from their pastor that made them feel dirty. Making matters worse is the rampant hypocrisy in religion. The same leaders who set strict boundaries on sexuality are often exposed for exploiting sex in their private lives. When their sins come to light, they’re revealed as consumers of pornography, prostitution and illegal sex-enhancing drugs. Certainly, not all spiritual leaders are guilty of this kind of hypocrisy, but it is prevalent enough to cast a shadow on the world’s prominent religions.
The devout Christian women I know tend to heed their leaders’ advice. Every piece of clothing is viewed through the lens of lust. Will this shirt show too much cleavage? Is my hemline too short? Am I going to cause a man to sin? They end up thinking about their cleavage as much as the men around them do.
I once heard a pastor chide women in his church for wearing tops that were cut too low. If the congregation wasn’t thinking about breasts walking into the building, they were certainly thinking about them as they walked out. I heard nothing else the pastor said that day. I kept thinking to myself: How low it too low? Who is the appointed Cleavage Monitor? Who draws the line between sinner and saint?
Years ago, my brother told me that if a man is going to lust, he’s going to lust. You could put a girl in a potato sack and he’d still become aroused. It’s our own conscience that must resolve the questions of sexual expression and attire.</p>

<p>Enhanced by breasts, hips and figures that curve, a woman’s body is shaped by God. It’s a beautiful piece of art, meant to be alluring and sensual in all the right places. But religious women feel insecure about their curves to the point of layering on their clothes until they’ve covered every inch of their femininity.</p>

<p>This point was driven home by a friend, who told me about a film crew from a local news organization that was reporting on a major Christian women’s conference in her city. She knew about the situation because she worked at the conference behind the scenes. The crew was trying to wrap the shoot, but they couldn’t seem to get the footage they wanted. The hold-up? They needed an interview and couldn’t find a single woman, she was told, who looked like a cute, normal girl and not “a bag lady.”</p>

<p>Are women meant to live this way? Is this what God requires of us? Does God want us to feel shame about our sexuality? Women deserve a shame-free existence. They should explore, adore and adorn their shapes. There’s nothing shameful about a womanly figure that evokes sexual feelings, because women, like men, were designed to have sex. It’s natural. There are ways to embrace our figures, without putting them on display, to celebrate them and keep them sacred.</p></blockquote>

<p>Still others like Dianne Anderson are speaking out on the damaging nature of denying women sexual agency
http://diannaeanderson.net/?p=1288
When Chrisitans discuss sex,</p>

<blockquote><p>Consent doesn’t enter into the picture, because if enthusiastic, positive consent is discussed, it might end up teaching people that healthy sexual relationships can and do happen outside of a marriage relationship. And then all hell breaks loose!</p></blockquote>

<p>http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/christians-idolize-virginity</p>

<p>http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2013/02/christian-bloggers-pushing-back-on-virginity.html</p>

<p>Dan Fincke of Cammels with Hammers points out that many <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2011/02/sex-and-apostasy/">parents who themselves lived a life of moderate libertinism are happy to have their children inculcated into a doctrine of asceticism they could never follow</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>When it is actually beneficial in practice for people to reject fundamentalist Christian restrictiveness about sex, they leave the church.  When they are married and raising children, suddenly they endorse a system of values that conveniently allows that only married people can have sex and that their teenage and young adult children cannot.</p>

<p>Religious people of this sort are some of the worst and most blithe and uncondemned species of hypocrites out there.  They condemn the same healthy process of normal sexual development they personally benefited from while considering themselves especially devout and moral people for “repenting” of their ways when all they did was get married and find the church suddenly extremely convenient to their sexual goals of monogamy and their desire that their teenage and young adult children remain chaste.</p></blockquote>

    <id>http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2013/03/31/shaming-tracts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just came across one of the most condescending, self righteous and judgemental Christian tracts to shame young people about their lives I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>

<p><img class="center Satisfied, Teen Ager" src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/teenager1.jpg">
<img class="center Satisfied, Teen Ager" src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/teenager2.jpg"></p>

<blockquote><p>Within you there is an emptiness - a vacuum. You&#8217;ve tried to find satisfaction. Drinking, smoking, petting, indulging in shameful sex acts has not filled that void. Yet, you seek for greater thrills, you cultivate a deeper love for the pleasures of this world. You&#8217;ve tried to convince yourself that you are happy, but <em>HELL</em> rages within.</p>

<p><em>SOON!</em> you will stand before the almighty God on the judgment day and give an account of every dirty joke, curse word, evil action and neglected opportunity of being saved from all sin.</p>

<p><em>REPENTANCE</em> means confessing all our sins&#8230; <em>REPENTANCE</em> means forsaking all sin, a complete turning away from being a rebel, from ungodly friends, form conformity with the world, from secret sins and habits of the flesh, from filthy books and naked photographs, from dirty stories and unclean jokes, from everything and everybody that would hinder you from being one hundred percent for Jesus Christ&#8230;</p>

<p><em>REPENTANCE</em> means making restitution. In other words, make your back paths straight; make things right with those whom you have wronged. This includes taking back stolen property or paying back stolen money. Restitution involves asking of forgiveness of parents for improper attitudes towards them, disobedience, and disrespect.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course most tracts aren&#8217;t intended to convert people to Christianity, just to satisfy the &#8216;evangelist&#8217; that they are doing their job by presenting the very worst of Christian judgementalism. Jack Chick&#8217;s <a href="http://www.stufffundieslike.com/2013/02/catholic-bashing/">rabid anti-Catholic sentiment makes this clear</a>:</p>

<p>Of course, people giving out these tracts don&#8217;t care about how the recipients receive them, they are really only there to give out as many tracts as quickly as possible <a href="http://www.stufffundieslike.com/2012/11/tract-smack-down/">to appease other Christians</a>:</p>

    <link href="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2013/03/28/millenial-marriage-eq/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-28T08:08:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2013/03/28/millenial-marriage-eq</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/hrc-lesbian.jpg" alt="Red bars of the Human Rights Campaign with Lesbian Justice and Liberty" /></p>

<p>This week the US supreme court is assessing the contitutional validity of state laws prohibiting same-sex marriage. There is the potential to overturn California&#8217;s Proposition 8, and possibly the Defence of Marriage Act. A large number of millenials have been following the SCOTUS, with many changing their profile pictures to an equality symbol. Data from Pew Research show that while other demographic groups have relativly unchanged levels of support for same-sex marriage, <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2013/03/20/growing-support-for-gay-marriage-changed-minds-and-changing-demographics/">17% of millenials have changed their minds over the last 3 years</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/pew-gay-marriage.png" alt="Pew Gay Marriage" /></p>

<p>A range of significant Democratic figures have given their support to the campaign, like Hillary Clinton recently joining Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Obama himself stated his views &#8216;evolved&#8217; from discussions with his daughters, subtley refuting the argument that gay marriage is a threat to children. A number of Republican figures like Dick Cheney, Laura Bush, and Colin Powell have already come out in support of gay marriage, and recently another 75 Republicans added their support, including <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/02/republicans-urge-scotus-to-support-gay-marriage.html">former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman and former ebay CEO Meg Whitman</a>. Rob Portman, an original voter for DOMA, also changed his mind after <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/03/15/rob-portman-gay-marriage-son/1988375/">his son came out as gay</a>.</p>

<p>Bill O&#8217;Reilly has also <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2013/03/27/oreilly_gay_marriage_backers_have_compelling_argument_against_bible_thumpers.html">changed his view, on March 26 of the O&#8217;Reilly Factor</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS: I mean, I think the country&#8217;s views on [same-sex marriage] are changing, they&#8217;re changing dramatically.</p>

<p>O&#8217;REILLY: But why are they changing?</p>

<p>KELLY: Well, because I think the same-sex marriage advocates have done a credible job in getting out there and making their case&#8230; I had an interview with Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council. What is it about calling a marriage &#8211; calling a gay union a marriage that offends you. How does it hurt a traditional, or a heterosexual marriage? And I didn&#8217;t hear anything articulated that was particularly persuasive&#8230;</p>

<p>O&#8217;REILLY: …I agree with you 100-percent. <strong>The compelling argument is on the side of homosexuals</strong>. That&#8217;s where the compelling argument is. &#8216;We&#8217;re Americans, we <strong>just want to be treated like everybody else</strong>.&#8217;</p>

<p>That’s a compelling argument. And to deny that, you’ve got to have a very strong argument on the other side. And <strong>the other side hasn’t been able to do anything but thump the Bible</strong>.</p>

<p>KELLY: Their best argument, thus far, has been, &#8216;well, marriage is an institution that for 2,000 has been about a man and a woman creating babies.&#8217;</p>

<p>O&#8217;REILLY: That&#8217;s right.</p>

<p>O&#8217;REILLY: &#8230;I live in New York, New York has [gay marriage], <strong>I&#8217;m fine with it. I want all Americans to be happy</strong>, I do.</p></blockquote>

<p>With opposition to same-sex marriage seemingly in free-fall, extreme Religious Right figures are coming up with explanations for how this has happened. And rather than acknowledge that social media allows millenials to change their minds quickly, and that the demographics of the US are changing, they&#8217;d rather engage in <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/wnd-our-tiny-tots-are-taught-homosexuality-weve-even-broken-them-thumb-sucking">kooky conspiracy theories about a hidden population control agenda</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>One has to wonder if the bigger motive behind the homosexual agenda isn’t to secretly achieve voluntary population control: Perhaps the ultimate goal is to save the planet from the inevitable destruction of man-made climate change. One could conclude that the sustainability efforts behind Agenda 21 would greatly benefit from same-sex partners who would no longer pollute the planet with the unwanted carbon footprints of tiny feet. Even those diesel-spewing school buses could become a welcomed relic of the past if enough people stopped procreating.</p></blockquote>

<p>The idea that the gay rights movement is a covert conspiracy to destroy capitalism by reducing procreation has been picked up by Matt Hagee:</p>

Matthew Hagee says gay marriage will result in couples no longer producing future consumers, which will spell the end of capitalism and society.</div>
</div>


<p>Susan Harris continues her theorising, worried about the influence that social media has over millenials:</p>

<blockquote><p>Chances are, if you’ve got a teenager on Facebook, they have been lured by curiosity to at least one of these sites. In addition to social media, well-known gay celebrities in comedy, news and music beat a steady drumbeat of tantalizing homosexual ideology for America’s youth…</p>

<p>Generation Q lives and breathes an intense obsession of their sexuality that is disturbing to outsiders. Insiders include gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transgenders, pansexuals and basically everyone who does not adhere to the archaic idea of a man and woman being attracted to each other, marrying and having children. More importantly, it consists of allies who loudly champion the cause for family and friends already immersed in this destructive culture…</p>

<p>We have reached the point where neither American laws nor accepted cultural norms will protect my rights as a Christian to protect my child from what my faith teaches is sinful and perverse behavior. Americans must not back down in the face of constant intimidation. The first step begins at home: naming the sin and teaching our children to love the sinner but hate the sin. <strong>The LGBT agenda is ensuring that our tiny tots are taught homosexuality before we’ve even broken them of thumb-sucking</strong>. By the time they are teenagers – feeling “different” like millions of teenagers before them – they are being sucked into the LGBTQ lifestyle because their parents and their communities put acceptance of man’s lusts above God’s law.</p>

<p>Our youth are embarking on a lonely, dark path of sexual confusion and its resulting sadness, disease and suicide. There will be no going back. Generation Q may have already slipped through our fingers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Clearly the only sane thing a God-fearing parent can do is to keep their tiny tots holed up in a basement for the first decade of life, away from the corrupting influence of the world.</p>

<p>Behind the claim that gays want to destroy capitalism is the concern that changing social mores and cultural norms, as well as efforts to reduce economic inequality will <a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/paul07/paul07_index.html">destroy the Religious Right</a>.</p>

    <id>http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2013/03/18/western-gospel</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Christians in the West have a habit of making all the depictions of biblical figures white. This is painfully evident in The Bible series on the History Channel. The series starts its Eurocentric presentation of Jewish scriptures with Adam and Eve as white supermodels:</p>

<p><img src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/adam-eve.jpg" alt="Adam and Eve as white supermodels" /></p>

<p>At least they figured out that &#8220;forbidden fruit&#8221; is a fig, long believed to be an aphrodisiac in the Middle East. The producers also cast Mohamen Mehdi Ouazanni as Satan, someone <a href="http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/television/barack-obama-lookalike-mohamen-mehdi-ouazanni-cast-as-satan-in-the-bible/story-e6frfmyi-1226600220510">many have commented has a resemblence to Barak Obama</a>:</p>

<p><img src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/satan-obama.jpg" alt="Barack Obama looks like Satan" /></p>

<p>While Jesus is shown as distinctively Causasian, Samson was cast as a black actor leading Reverend Wil Gafney to call the series <a href="http://www.wilgafney.com/2013/03/11/black-samson-white-women-on-the-history-channel">&#8220;a continuation of slave-holding racist exegesis.&#8221;</a> The December 2002 cover of Popular Mechanics featured a <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/forensics/1282186">reconstruction of the faces of males from around the time of Jesus</a>. The New Testament says that Jesus disappeared into crowds, and if Jesus looked like other men of the time this is what he would have looked like:</p>

<p><img src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/black-jesus-face.jpg" alt="Black Jesus by Popular Mechanics" /></p>

<p>The Irish producer Roma Downey chose to cast herself as Mary the mother of Jesus, and chose to give the role of Jesus of Nazareth to a similarly white skinned Portugese actor Diogo Morgado:</p>

<p><img src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/white-jesus.jpg" alt="White Jesus" /></p>

<p>If Jesus ever had hair this long, he&#8217;d probably get it stuck in his vice or his lathe. Europeans love to show Jesus with long hair, despite Paul&#8217;s teaching in 1 Corinthians 11:14 clearly specifying &#8220;Does not nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace for him&#8221;. In fact, many contemporary scholars have noted that the Corinthian church existed at a time when male prostitutes had longer hair than other men to make them stand out as homosexuals. And despite all this, ever since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_movement">Jesus movement</a> co-opted New Age culture of the 70&#8217;s, modern renditions of Jesus show him as a long haired white hippie.</p>

<p>But this isn&#8217;t the only way that Westerners present biblical stories specifically moulded to their target audience, against the grain of what the bible actually says. Western individualists love to read bible passages as written specifically for them, ignoring the original audience and context. For most of the history of Christianity, lay people did not read scriputre themselves, they had the bible read in a corporate context. It wasn&#8217;t until 1455 that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg_Bible">Johannes Gutenberg mass produced 180 bibles</a> and until 1561 that John Knox demanded universal education.</p>

<p>Now Americans complain that while most <a href="http://global.christianpost.com/news/dr-lamar-vest-on-why-owning-seven-bibles-is-not-enough-70608/">own four to seven bibles they hardly ever get time to read them</a>. Instead they&#8217;ll be coerced to read the bible <a href="http://au.christiantoday.com/article/Daily-Bible-reading-best-predictor-of-spiritual-growth/13987.htm">25 words at a time</a>. Not only are Westerners time-poor, they all too often seek a <a href="rachelheldevans.com/blog/bible-not-into-you">&#8220;reaffirmation of the individualistic, me-centered, and consumerist tendencies of American religious culture.&#8221;</a> Many megachurches are happy to give them a &#8220;seeker friendly&#8221; doctrine written by and for modern American individualists:</p>

<blockquote><p>Passages that were originally written for groups of people, and intended to be read and applied in a community setting (the nation of Israel, the various early churches, the first followers of Jesus), have been manipulated to communicate a personal, individual message&#8230;</p>

<p>We see this everywhere: in worship set lists that focus exclusively on individual worship, individual sin, and individual connection to God; in desk calendars that turn Jeremiah 29:11 (“For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord…”)  into a personal promise; in the disproportionate emphasis in our churches on personal Bible study, personal prayer, and one’s “personal walk with God.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Worse, publishers responding to people who like the sound of their own names will &#8220;personalize&#8221; the bible for them, massaging scripture into an ego stoking circlejerk. Isiah 53 no longer reads &#8220;he was pierced for <strong>our</strong> transgressions&#8221; but can be made to say &#8220;he was pierced for <strong>Rachel&#8217;s</strong> transgressions. He was crushed for <strong>Rachel&#8217;s</strong> iniquities.&#8221; The website lets you put in literally any name at all:</p>

<p><img src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/dahmer.jpg" alt="The bible according to Jeffrey Dahmer" /></p>

<h3>It ain&#8217;t in the bible, but it outta be</h3>

<p>This culture is happy to change the bible not only to suit the emotional desires of materialists but also to make it suit contemporary social and political needs. Often Jesus is not presented as a redeemer saving individuals into a community, but is presented as a &#8220;package deal&#8221; that will provide for individual emotional and physical wants and needs, so long as they conform to the social and political aims of the church of the day.</p>

<p>Making the message &#8220;culturally relevant&#8221; can lead to presenting cultural idiosyncrasies along with religious doctrines until the two become confused. Right wing Christians love to say phrases like &#8220;God helps those who help themselves&#8221;. When challenged on where in the bible it actually says it, they&#8217;ll usually respond &#8220;well it ain&#8217;t in the bible, but it outta be&#8221;. Other common platitudes like &#8220;When God closes a door he opens a window&#8221; might give comfort to those struggling with flatulence, but are similarly unscriptural.</p>

<p>Ultimately many Christians don&#8217;t view God though the bible, they view the bible through the lens of the culture they&#8217;re in, which is why their god&#8217;s actions and character reflect their own personal desires and perferences. When one&#8217;s understanding of the Christian God is grounded in pre-existing cultural and social assumptions, statements like this make sense:</p>

<p><img src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/god-husband.jpg" alt="God as husband" /></p>

<p>This &#8220;deal&#8221; is not the gospel of Christianity, it&#8217;s a <a href="http://ajoyfulvapour.tumblr.com/post/45499852946/this-is-a-load-of-crap-where-is-its-scriptual">load of crap, and a lie, and a load of bollocks</a>. If they don&#8217;t get these stupid ideas from the bible, where do they get them from? There is a widespread cultural assumption that &#8220;everyone knows&#8221; that god wants people to marry &#8220;the one&#8221; for them. Many Christians are happy to play into cultural anxieties about love, sex and singleness to present marriage as part of the &#8220;package deal&#8221; of Christianity. Dagmar Herzog describes the American religious right as pushing a regressive social agenda by painting a rosy picture of marriage, and building on the insecurities of sexual inexperience in youth:</p>

Author Dagmar Herzog examines the efforts of religious conservatives to influence sexual culture in the U.S. during the Bush Administration. Herzog claims widespread increases in religion-themed sex education, therapy, and medical research as examples.

&#8212;&#8211;

Has the conservative agenda come to dominate the national and international conversation on sexual rights?

Obama&#8217;s victory and the vote against abortion bans in Colorado and South Dakota brought some sexual rights back from the edge of a political precipice, but others remain in the balance.

Join scholars, journalists, and policy makers to talk about how we can help the new administration change policies and reframe national and international thinking on sexual rights.

Participants include Dagmar Herzog, author of Sex in Crisis: The New Sexual Revolution and the Future of American Politics and Professor of History, Lynn Paltrow, Executive Director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women, Nation columnist Katha Pollitt, and Faye Wattleton, Director of the Center for the Advancement of Women.

Discussant: Rosalind Petchesky, author of Sexuality, Health and Human Rights and Distinguished Professor of Political Science. Moderated by Michelle Fine, Distinguished Professor of Psychology at the Graduate Center, CUNY - City University of New York

Dagmar Herzog is a Professor of History at the Graduate Center, CUNY, where she focuses on modern European history, the history of sexuality, and the history of the religion.

<p>The Materialistic Western culture is built on functional saviours. Shampoo is sold to people by telling them that unclean hair makes them undesirable, then promising to make them beautiful if they buy more product. Targetting this culture with &#8220;seeker friendly&#8221; material often means presenting a relationship Jesus as a functional saviour, a means to an end for the individual, rather than an end in and of itself. &#8220;The most important relationship you can have &#8211; one that will make you a better husband and father &#8211; is a relationship with God&#8221; reads an altar call in one <a href="http://www.everystudent.com/features/wolves.html">mendacious promise of long lasting and happy marriages</a>. Another promises &#8221;<a href="http://www.everystudent.com/features/marriage.html">hope for a lasting marriage</a>&#8221; if only one accepts Jesus. Others offer Jesus as a way for <a href="http://www.everystudent.com/wires/toxic.html">men</a> and <a href="http://www.everystudent.com/wires/jenniferm.html">women</a> to stop looking at porn. People accepting these altar calls and praying their sinner&#8217;s prayers will never know what they&#8217;ve accepted unless they read the bible to understand what is actually in it, and what &#8220;outta be&#8221;.</p>

<h3>Myths and misinformation pushing shame and intimidation</h3>

<p>The relationships altar call comes after two and a half A4 pages of bullshit about how &#8220;Waiting to have sex with my wife will mean better sex in my marriage.&#8221; It launches into all the standard canards Christians have been told to believe &#8220;the more I bond with other girls, the less I&#8217;ll be able to bond with my future wife. It&#8217;s like a piece of scotch tape &#8211; the more you use it on different surfaces, the less it sticks to things.&#8221; When entire mission strategies are built around ignorance on sex and relationships, Christians will do anything in their power to promote misinformation. Because they are offering Chrsitianity as a solution to problems of their own making.</p>

<p>Abstinance only sex education programs reinforce ignorance in 30% of United States public schools. They <a href="http://www.siecus.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.ViewPage&amp;PageID=1199">teach canards like</a> “Condoms can never protect someone from the emotional problems that can result from multiple sexual partners and premature sexual activity.” And “AIDS can be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact.” They discourage the responsible use of barrier methods like condoms, teaching that “The only safe sex is in a marriage relationship where a man and a woman are faithful to each other for life.”</p>

<p>These programs not only promote the idea that premarital sex has risks, but demonises it as permanantly scarring. “If [a girl] has been involved in sexual activity…sexually, she is no longer a virgin, she is no longer pure, unspoiled, fresh&#8221; they teach. They warn that “The consequences of pre-marital sex include “guilt, disappointment, worry, depression, sadness, loneliness, and loss of self-esteem.” They warn 6th grade children &#8220;Going on this ride could change your life forever, result in poverty, heartache, disease, and even DEATH.” It goes on to say that many “will board this ride and come out losers.” The manual goads “did you know that sexual activity outside of the commitment of marriage could put YOUR FUTURE at risk?”</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t believe that they teach children that they&#8217;ll die, watch this:</p>

<p>These teachings encourage a culture of shame and permanent condemnation. In a survey, when researchers dropped a live cockroach into orange juice, then removed the cockroach and sterilised the juice, <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com.au/2013/02/the-psychology-of-christian-purity.html">the majority of participants wouldn&#8217;t drink it</a>. Paul Rozin, author of the study also found that <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-10-27/entertainment/0510260352_1_disgusting-paul-rozin-important-part">40% of participants would refuse to eat poo-shaped chocolate, or drink juice from a brand-new bedpan</a>. Even when people know that disgusting looking food is safe to eat, emotionally, many refuse. While many sins that the bible speaks against are presented as mistakes, conservative evangelicals always talk about sexual integrity in terms of purity. They encourage the view that anyone who isn&#8217;t a virgin is permanantly broken, corrupted, contaminated and that they cannot make themselves clean again.</p>

<h3>The overreach and failure of the purity doctrine</h3>

<p>Demonising pre-marital sex as permanantly scarring and unforgivable has created a culture in which people are afraid even to date. &#8220;There is no condom for the human heart&#8221; teach the fear mongers. They preach not only that virginity is the most important gift a girl can give her husband, but that they should be &#8220;emotional virgins&#8221; and not <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2011/09/love-virginity.html">&#8220;give away pieces of their heart.&#8221;</a> This is bullshit. And yet, it has almost lured a <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2012/10/what-i-learned-from-joshua-harris.html">whole generation out of dating until they are sure they can marry</a>. This hooks into the intuition that &#8220;everyone knows&#8221; that God will provide them with &#8220;the one&#8221;, which &#8220;outta be&#8221; in the bible there somewhere. Single Christian women who spend the last decade in the purity culture suddenly find themselves <a href="http://sydneyanglicans.net/life/daytoday/single_christian_female_30">ostracised and isolated as church ministries direct all their 30+ ministries to families</a>.</p>

<p>Many women have given up on wearing purity rings. For some, it&#8217;s because they <a href="http://gracefortheroad.com/2012/02/03/idontwait/">feel complete in their relationship with Jesus, and aren&#8217;t &#8220;waiting&#8221; anymore</a></p>

<blockquote><p>There are a lot of girls out there who don’t know who God is anymore – the God of their youth group years just isn’t working out. Back then, that God said to wait for sex until they are married, until He brings the right man along for a husband. They signed a card and put it on the altar and pledged to wait&#8230;</p>

<p>Some of them have prayed their whole lives for a husband, and he hasn’t shown up. They’ve heard the advice to “be the woman God made you to be, focus on that, and then the husband will come.” They’ve read “Lady in Waiting,” gotten super involved in church and honed their domestic skills.</p>

<p>More than a decade ago, a youth leader handed them a photocopied poem in Sunday School written to them from “God” that said, “The reason you don’t have anyone yet is because you’re not fully satisfied in Me. You have to be satisfied with Me and then when you least expect it, I’ll bring you the person I meant for you.”</p>

<p>&#8230;Many of them – if they’re honest – will tell you that time has passed, and it’s wrecking their view of God.</p></blockquote>

<p>Others have given up on the culture of bullying and intimidation that <a href="http://sexetc.org/info-center/post/why-i-stopped-wearing-a-purity-ring/">accompanies the purity culture</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Originally, when I made the commitment to wait until marriage, I really only saw my ring as a symbol of how personally valuable my virginity was to me. However, after I saw how readily my peers bullied and mocked girls who they thought were sexually active, my ring seemed like more of a constant reminder of how dirty and useless people might think I was if I wasn’t a virgin anymore.</p></blockquote>

<p>For some, it&#8217;s the knowledge that <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1802108/">95% of Americans have sex before marriage</a>, or that <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2768056/">Five years after taking a virginity pledge, 82% of pledgers denied having ever pledged</a>. Others note that even in Southern Baptist churches <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3156853/">70% of engaged Christians quietly have sex before marrying</a>. Many women who hit this inevitable conclusion are finding the courage to speak out about the <a href="http://www.prodigalmagazine.com/the-day-i-turned-in-my-v-card/">deep and long lasting damage of the purity culture</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p> I broke a barrier and gave up an idea I’d held onto as a “Good Christian Girl” for a long, long time. If you grew up in American Christian culture, you know that a statement like mine is one of the most life changing, socially desolating, parentally disappointing pronouncements you can make. Especially if you’re a girl.</p>

<p> But I don’t care anymore; I’m done with virginity.</p>

<p> I’m done with that word and that idea. I’m done defining myself, my past and my future, in terms of who’s what has been where, or hasn’t. I’m done with stories for virgins and non-virgins, promises and praises, and sentiments of “restoration” that just push forward bulldozer loads of this horrible twisted shame.</p></blockquote>

<p>Others are speaking out for those who have <a href="http://deeperstory.com/i-am-damaged-goods/">been damaged by the notion that their sexual past is keeping them back from being a Christian</a></p>

<blockquote><p> I was nineteen years old and crazy in love with Jesus when that preacher told an auditorium I was “damaged goods” because of my sexual past. He was making every effort to encourage this crowd of young adults to “stay pure for marriage.” He was passionate, yes, well-intentioned, and he was a good speaker, very convincing indeed.</p>

<p> And he stood up there and shamed me, over and over and over again.</p>

<p> Oh, he didn’t call me up to the front and name me. But he stood up there and talked about me with such disgust, like I couldn’t be in that real-life crowd of young people worshipping in that church. I felt spotlighted and singled out amongst the holy, surely my red face announced my guilt to every one&#8230;</p>

<p> And so here, now, I’ll stand up and say it, the way I wish someone had said it to me fifteen years ago when I was sitting in that packed auditorium with my heart racing, wrists aching, eyes stinging, drowning and silenced by the imposition of shame masquerading as ashes of repentance:</p>

<p> “So, you had sex before you were married.</p>

<p> It’s okay.</p>

<p> Really. It’s okay.</p>

<p> There is no shame in Christ’s love. Let him without sin cast the first stone. You are more than your virginity – or lack thereof – and more than your sexual past.</p></blockquote>

<p>Others who kept their virginity are also <a href="http://www.elizabethesther.com/2013/01/virginity-new-improved.html">pushing back on the purity culture that teaches that non-sexual relationships are as dangerous as sexual ones</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p> Yes, I was a virgin on my wedding day. Then again, I was only 20. Yes, remaining a virgin until my wedding day saved me from some romantic heartbreak. Then again, I’ve had other heartbreaks. Yes, chastity is special. Then again, so are lots of virtues. Except, as a 20 year old bride, I thought virginity was extra-extra special and would win me lots of special prizes like: a happily ever after marriage.</p>

<p> It took me a long time to realize I idolized virginity. I kept saying I was just promoting virtue and chastity and purity! Nothing wrong with pushing purity, right? Nothing wrong with Being Good!</p>

<p> Like other Christians, I talked about the “sacrifice” of abstinence. There were princess-themed books about saving our first kiss. Some of us wore purity rings and made pledges to our Daddies not to have sex until we’re married.</p>

<p> Ultimately, we implied that <strong>a woman’s inherent worth and dignity could be measured by whether or not a man has touched her</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>As women who spend their young adult years believing that pre-marital sex is &#8220;not all it&#8217;s cracked up to be&#8221; start hitting struggles in their own &#8220;perfect&#8221; marriages, the church is happy to offer a whole industry of Christian sex advice.</p>

<h3>Race to the bottom</h3>

<p>This gospel offers &#8220;perfect&#8221; sex in a &#8220;perfect&#8221; marriage so long as one accepts the &#8220;package deal&#8221; of White Jesus with the cultural vestments of looking, sounding and voting Christian.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Danny Nalliah, a false prophet running the apostate church &#8220;Catch the Fire Ministries&#8221; has launched his own political party, &#8220;rise up Australia&#8221;. Nalliah&#8217;s church has been <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/costello-slams-cults-retribution-claims/story-e6frg6of-1111118814587">denounced as a cult by Peter Costello, someone his false prophesy lead him to &#8216;anoint&#8217; as Australia&#8217;s future Prime Minister</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>A FURIOUS Peter Costello has rounded on a Christian cult for suggesting the Victorian bushfires were divine retribution for the state&#8217;s abortion laws, describing it as &#8220;beyond the bounds of decency&#8221;.</p>

<p>Just three weeks ago, the former federal treasurer sent a video message to a special Australia Day prayer meeting organised by Catch the Fire Ministries leader Danny Nalliah.</p>

<p>But he reacted angrily to a statement by Mr Nalliah yesterday recalling a dream concerning the consequences of Victorian abortion legislation that became law last year.</p>

<p>The preacher claimed God&#8217;s &#8220;conditional protection&#8221; had been &#8220;removed from the nation of Australia, particular Victoria, for approving the slaughter of innocent children in the womb&#8221;.</p>

<p>&#8220;To link the death and the suffering of bushfire victims to other political events is appalling, heartless and wrong,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those who have suffered deserve every support and sympathy. It is beyond the bounds of decency to try to make moral or political points out of such a tragedy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Nalliah&#8217;s full prophesy <a href="https://signposts02.wordpress.com/2009/02/14/nalliah-prophecy-claims-fall-short/">said this</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“I saw a man firing randomly with a weapon at people on the streets and many were falling dead. I was very disturbed and was crying. Then the scene changed and I saw fire everywhere with flames burning very high and uncontrollably. With this I awoke from my dream with the interpretation as the following words came to me in a flash from the Spirit of God,  ‘My wrath is about to be released upon Australia, in particular Victoria, for approving the slaughter of the innocent children in the womb.  Now, call on My people to repent and pray!’”</p></blockquote>

<p>This is false prophesy; there have been no major mass murders since 1996. If the Victorian bushfires really were God&#8217;s judgement for abortion legislation, then where is the gunman? In reality, <a href="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2013/01/20/rick-perry/">Australian gun control works much better than school prayer</a>.</p>

<p>Nalliah also incorrectly predicted that <a href="http://www.christian-witness.org/blog/2007/11/26/catch-the-fire%E2%80%93sequel/">Howard would win in the 2007 election before stepping aside for Costello to become Prime Minister</a>. He <a href="http://www.crikey.com.au/2007/08/14/costello-gods-own-prime-minister/">likens himself to the prophet Samuel anointing David</a> &#8220;The Lord spoke clearly to me about how Prophet Samuel in the Word of God was sent to anoint David as the future King of Israel&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>I thank the Lord that I just had a one to one meeting with Peter Costello [and Howard]&#8230; The Lord had given me a clear prophetic Word for both of them and I thank Him I was able to deliver His Word in addition to praying with both of these Federal Government Leaders&#8230;</p>

<p>I will boldly declare that Prime Minister John Howard will be re-elected in the November election (if the Body of Christ unites in prayer and action) and pass the leadership onto Peter Costello sometime after.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nalliah waters down his prophesy by hedging his bets on whether Christians pray the right way, creating an &#8220;out&#8221; for his faulty prophesy. As Rev Dr Gordon Moyes notes, &#8220;True prophets never give a “conditional” word of prophecy.&#8221; Moyes goes on to note that</p>

<blockquote><p>The majority of patients coming to the psychiatrists I have been responsible for employing in Wesley Mission’s Mental Health Hospitals claim God speaks to them. In other Christian circles and in Christian books, I note some people seek to get their own way by using God speaking to them as almost a way of stopping any questioning of their ideas.</p></blockquote>

<p>The American televangelist Kenneth Copeland confirmed Nalliah’s prophetic anointing of John Howard as Prime Minister, declaring that <a href="http://jmm.aaa.net.au/articles/20588.htm">Howard was “God’s man in Australia”</a>.</p>

<p>The Australian recounts the &#8220;preparation&#8221; (anointing as God&#8217;s elect) that happened with Costello:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr Nalliah met Mr Costello ahead of the 2007 election to &#8220;prepare&#8221; him for the prime ministership. A church member publicly recounted an episode where &#8220;the spirit of God suddenly moved me to cry out in the loud Aboriginal-like tongue followed by the shouting out several times of &#8216;the honourable Peter Costello, prime minister-elect of Australia&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>And just ahead of an Australia Day prayer meeting, Mr Nalliah announced: &#8220;Our silent prayer is that Peter &#8230; will be here to take the leadership of the party and lead the nation into victory as prime minister.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Nalliah <a href="http://www.christian-witness.org/blog/2007/07/13/pentecostal-disgrace-catch-the-fire-honouring-the-late-frank-houston/">honoured the self-consessed child molester Frank Houston as the greatest influence on his ministry</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The apostle Paul said that when he came to the church at Corinth it wasn’t with wise and persuasive words but it was with a demonstration of the Holy Spirit’s power&#8230; And that’s exactly how I knew Pastor Frank Houston. He was a man who moved in the power of the Holy Ghost. His heart was for real salvations, real healings, and real deliverances. I was fortunate enough to be a guest in his house on numerous occasions.. He was an inspiration not just to me but to many other spiritual sons and daughters throughout this nation.</p>

<p>I love Papa Frank with all my heart. I wish I could give him a big hug.</p></blockquote>

<p>Pastor Bob Cotton goes on to elaborate about his and Nalliah&#8217;s imitation of Houston&#8217;s techniques:</p>

<blockquote><p>I would ring him up sometimes and I’d say, ‘Pastor Frank. This devil - I couldn’t shift it the other day. What do you reckon?’ And he’d start to tell me a few little insights and different things that he’d known in the past, and we’ve seen many people come into freedom&#8230; It’s my honour to stand here today and say Pastor Frank wasn’t just a father in the faith to me, he was one of my closest mates and I love him. I cherish his memory and, like Danny, I wish he were here so I could give him a great big hug tonight because there was nobody quite like [him]</p></blockquote>

<p>Houston was expelled from his denomination for the destructive effect that his sexual abuse had on the church <a href="http://www.christian-witness.org/blog/2007/11/26/cetf-catch-the-fire-a-letter-to-the-editor/">and on victims</a>. By Nalliah&#8217;s own confession, he did not preach with logic and reason, but with signs and wonders. Given Houston&#8217;s history of sexually abusing multiple boys he was clearly not inspired or empowered by the Holy Spirit, and his signs and wonders were faked. Nalliah has learned to perform all of his spurious miracles from his spiritual father, refining the techniques and making even more aggrandised claims of raising three people from the dead.</p>

<p>Now Nalliah is running for office, hoping for a resurgence of Tea Party hysteria to propel an anti-Islamic, climate change denialist agenda into parliament.  Nalliah previously tried to <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/federal-election/gillard-bid-to-win-back-christians-20100805-11krh.html#ixzz2KepvdQfT">smear the Prime Minister for her atheism</a>. This sounds like the hysteria of Tea Party style dominionist rhetoric, claiming that the country was started on Christian values, and the only way to hold up democracy is to have Christian leaders occupying every leadership position.</p>

<blockquote><p>Danny Nalliah&#8230; released a statement giving five reasons not to vote Labor: it would be a vote for the Greens, Prime Minister Julia Gillard is in a de facto relationship, she is childless, she is an atheist, and she refused to take an oath on the Bible.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nalliah&#8217;s politics <a href="http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/new-political-party-rise-up-australia-wants-muslim-intake-cuts/story-fndo1gb8-1226575716789">have attracted discussion</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Pastor Daniel”, of Catch the Fire Ministries, says a conversation with Jesus that went from 3.40am to 6am one morning prompted his move to Australia.</p>

<p>Since arriving here he has claimed that Victoria’s abortion laws caused the Black Saturday bushfires and that his prayers have brought dead people back to life.</p>

<p>He declared Prime Minister Julia Gillard a heathen “living in sin” and former Greens leader Bob Brown an “openly practising homosexual” and said that he felt sick to the stomach watching them shake hands.</p>

<p>Rise Up Australia will push for cuts to Australia’s “Muslim intake”, for an end to multiculturalism and for protection of Australia’s Judaeo-Christian heritage&#8230;</p>

<p>Climate change skeptic Christopher Monckton spoke at the launch, giving a very graphic description of abortions and leading a round of patriotic cheers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Using abortion as a highly emotional topic as a <a href="http://localhost:4321/blog/2013/01/03/rentier-theology/">smokescreen for an agenda that is factually and morally bankrupt is a common tactic for extreme right wing politics</a>. Nalliah claims to be protecting Australia&#8217;s &#8220;Judeo Christian&#8221; heritage, a classic racist dog whistle. The RUA claim they want &#8220;To promote harmony, freedom and tolerance among Australians; specifically we oppose multiculturalism&#8221;. Great. Nalliah in 2004 called for Christians to <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1217824.htm">&#8220;pull down Satan&#8217;s strongholds&#8221;, including brothels and gambling places, mosques and temples</a>.</p>

<p>By claiming Christianity as the inspiration for their extremist politics, Nalliah and Monkton may pick up a small number of votes, but will continue the perception that Chrisitanity is strongly tied to a right wing agenda. If Christians themselves don&#8217;t speak out against this, it will give significant credance to those who want to wipe all religion from public life in Australia.</p>

    <link href="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2013/02/10/bible-violence/"/>
    <updated>2013-02-10T16:40:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2013/02/10/bible-violence</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/bible-gun.jpg" alt="Bible used to justify weapons today" /></p>

<p>Throughout history, the bible has been used as justification for various wars. Dr. Eric Seibert suggests that modern readers <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/2013/02/when-the-good-book-is-bad-challenging-the-bibles-violent-portrayals-of-god/">should be mindful of the consequences of</a> a literal interpretation of problematic Old Testament passages:</p>

<blockquote><p>What happens when reading the Bible pushes people away from God rather than leads them closer to God?</p>

<p>If we feel compelled to accept what we read at face value, and are forbidden from asking honest questions about the troublesome texts we encounter, we run the risk of using the Bible in ways that may harm others</p></blockquote>

<p>In many Old Testament passages, Seibert writes, &#8220;lethal violence is condoned and sometimes even celebrated.  Passages like these create significant problems for Christian readers.&#8221; He <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/2013/02/when-the-bible-sanctions-violence-must-we/">continues</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>It is extremely dangerous to endorse violent texts like these. Tragically, this kind of approval has often led to future acts of violence against others&#8230;</p>

<p>As Christians, we have a moral obligation to critique the assumption that violence is somehow “virtuous,” in spite of what the Bible suggests on numerous occasions.</p>

<p>Violence is not a virtue. It is not a fruit of the spirit or a mark of discipleship&#8230; There are no moral grounds for slaughtering babies, infants, or toddlers. Yet the Bible justifies their extermination on more than one occasion.</p>

<p>Surely, those of us who follow the prince of Peace, the God of Life, must raise our voices in protest and object. We must say, “This is not right!” Such violence is never justifiable and should never be condoned.</p></blockquote>

<p>Seibert <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/2013/02/learning-to-read-the-bible-nonviolently/">suggests that readers engage with violence by trying to empathise with the victims</a>. This would be in line with Jesus&#8217;s teaching on the golden rule.</p>

<p>The question he&#8217;s getting at is whether violence in the Old Testament demonstrates inspiration if it must be resolved with an apparent contradiction with the incarnation of Logos. Working though these issues and understanding the history and interpreting the OT though an NT lens, without interposing modern secular moral standards.</p>

<blockquote><p>Reading this way sensitizes us to the problem of violence in these texts and keeps us from simplistically classifying such moral atrocities as good.</p>

<p>The conquest narrative in Joshua 6-11 reminds us that religious violence is extremely dangerous because it gives divine sanction to behaviors that in any other context would be deemed immoral. Moreover, if one assumes the narrative was intended to bolster the political ambitions of King Josiah, it stands as a sober reminder of the way political leaders sometimes use religion to promote their own agendas.</p></blockquote>

    <updated>2013-02-07T18:38:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2013/02/07/reinventing-history</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>There is a funny thing about history. Even though there are countless books waiting to be investigated and read, myriad articles from the times, and an abundance of other evidence, we human beings would <a href="https://mabworld.wordpress.com/2012/02/27/the-fundamentalist-history-they-dont-want-you-to-know/">rather have someone else — one of our contemporaries — tell us what it is</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>As George Orwell opined in <em>Ninteen Eighty Four</em>, &#8220;whoever controls the present controls the past&#8221;.
Even though the US senate in 1797 that &#8221;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tripoli">the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion</a>,&#8221; it&#8217;s become common to hear right wing Christians insist the opposite:</p>

<p><img src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/jesus-constitution.jpg" alt="Jesus giving the US constitution to the founding fathers" /></p>

<p>Demographic changes in the United States mean that white evangelical Christians are a smaller and smaller voting bloc. As the Religious Right attempting to broaden their base to black and latino Christians, they emphasise anti-abortion and anti-gay positions, and try to downplay their history of segregationalist and White Supremacist links. They also try to claim that they have always been against legal access to abortions, despite <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5502785">evidence to the contrary</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Although various Roman Catholic groups denounced the ruling, and Christianity Today complained that the Roe decision “runs counter to the moral teachings of Christianity through the ages but also to the moral sense of the American people,” the vast majority of evangelical leaders said virtually nothing about it; many of those who did comment actually applauded the decision. W. Barry Garrett of Baptist Press wrote, “Religious liberty, human equality and justice are advanced by the Supreme Court abortion decision.” Indeed, even before the Roe decision, the messengers (delegates) to the 1971 Southern Baptist Convention gathering in St. Louis, Missouri, adopted a resolution that stated, “we call upon Southern Baptists to work for legislation that will allow the possibility of abortion under such conditions as rape, incest, clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother.” W.A. Criswell, former president of the Southern Baptist Convention and pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas, expressed his satisfaction with the Roe v. Wade ruling. “I have always felt that it was only after a child was born and had a life separate from its mother that it became an individual person,” the redoubtable fundamentalist declared, “and it has always, therefore, seemed to me that what is best for the mother and for the future should be allowed.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Religious Right wants to paint themselves as having always been anti-abortion, and tends to be quiet on their position about racism and civil rights. The Republicans have a history of inviting White Supremicist speakers to the Conservative Political Action Comitee, while at the same time trying to broaden their base to black voters. In fact, one of the biggest issues to galvinise white evangelical voters is opposition to the civil rights movement. Paul Weyrich of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress said:</p>

<blockquote><p>“What galvanised the Christian community was not abortion, school prayer, or the ERA. I am living witness to that because I was trying to get those people interested in those issues and I utterly failed. What changed their mind was Jimmy Carter’s intervention against the Christian schools, trying to deny them tax-exempt status on the basis of so-called de-facto segregation.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The religious right is now attempting to get black voters to join an anti-gay campaign, claiming that they were always on the side of civil rights. Matt Barber, the law dean of Liberty University (founded on pro-segregationalist grounds by Jerry Falwell) <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/matt-barber-whose-idol-backed-segregation-lectures-everyone-else-about-civil-rights-movement">claimed that the gay movement has &#8220;cynically co-opted and hijacked the language of the very, very noble civil rights movement and applied it to their disordered lifestyle.”</a></p>

<p>Next thing they&#8217;ll try and claim that Chrsitians have always been <a href="http://www.lva.virginia.gov/lib-edu/education/psd/nation/halifax.htm">against slavery</a>. When the Theistic Evolution crowd convinces more Christians of the scientific truth of evolution (that it is more than &#8220;just a theory&#8221;), they&#8217;ll claim that Christians always thought Genesis was compatible with science. And when the numbers of Americans opposing gay marriage drops they will next claim that they always supported gay rights. <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/survey-less-americans-believe-homosexuality-is-a-sin-nations-view-evolving-with-obamas-88141/">44% of Americans believed that homosexuality is a sin in September 2011, dropping to 37% in November 2012</a>, and <a href="http://www.lifeway.com/ArticleView?storeId=10054&amp;article=research-same-sex-marriage-civil-rights-issue-americans-say">64% think same-sex marriage is inevitable</a>. Is it because hollywood is pushing a campaign? Is it because political correctness is popular? Or is it because the media has exposed how, if evangelicals had their way, homosexuality would have the death penalty, like it is now in Uganda?</p>

<p>The more that Christians understand of their own history, the more they&#8217;ll start to realise that many of their key doctrines (like the idea that all of the bible is literally true and without error) are actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention_conservative_resurgence">new inventions</a>.</p>

<p>This dickhead is now <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/will-supreme-court-read-most-horrific-children-s-book-all-time">giving testimony to the US supreme court against marriage equality</a>, arguing homosexuality “is not an immutable characteristic&#8221;. His evidence mentions that he has authored a kid&#8217;s book on so-called gay &#8220;reparative therapy&#8221;, called Alfie&#8217;s Home. Here&#8217;s how he presents it:</p>

<blockquote><p>Alfie&#8217;s Home is the story of a boy who struggles with homosexuality well into his teenage years, then transitions naturally into heterosexuality after finding help and experiencing love in his family. This is the first resource of its kind for parents, teachers, students, counselors, clergy and anyone interested in helping children and adults heal their sexual identity.</p></blockquote>

<p>People for the American Way, a liberal advocacy group, call the book &#8221;<a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/will-supreme-court-read-most-horrific-children-s-book-all-time">the most horrifically disturbing children’s book we have ever seen</a>&#8221;. They describe the book:</p>

<blockquote><p> Alfie’s Home was published in 1993 by Cohen’s International Healing Foundation. It starts out with a picture of the protagonist on a boat with his dad.<br/>
 <img src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/Alfie-cover.jpg" alt="Alfie's Home Cover" />
 But it goes bad fast, going right for the right-wing myth that homosexuality is caused by childhood sexual abuse…<br/>
 <img src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/Alfie-6-7.jpg" alt="Alfie's Home p6-7" />
 …and by insufficiently attentive parents:<br/>
 <img src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/Alfie-8-9.jpg" alt="Alfie's Home p8-9" />
 Eventually, Alfie seeks help and takes part in the “touch therapy” advocated by Cohen…<br/>
 <img src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/Alfie-18-19.jpg" alt="Alfie's Home p18-19" />
 …which leads him to “realize that I’m not gay” and start dating a woman:<br/>
 <img src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/Alfie-24-25.jpg" alt="Alfie's Home p24-25" /></p></blockquote>

<p>I find it disturbing that they&#8217;re allowed to publish this book. Especially when you consider the list of most commonly challenged books is one where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_Tango_Makes_Three">a penguin has two dads</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><img src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/tango.jpg" alt="And Tango Makes Three Cover" />

I mean Jesus knew that there was a place for everything and it is not necessarily everyone’s place to come to Australia&#8230; Jesus was the best man who ever lived but that doesn’t mean that he said yes to everyone, that he was permissive to everything, and this idea that Jesus would say to every person who wanted to come to Australia, “Fine”, the door is open, I just don’t think is necessarily right</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s2859473.htm">From Q&amp;A 5 April 2010</a>. The statement was in response to a question &#8220;what would Jesus do&#8221; on assylum seekers, which unfortunately goaded Abbott into likening himself to Jesus. One bible&#8217;s footnote suggests Jesus drove out the temple traders because &#8220;Not only were the religious leaders robbing the people financially, but because of this they had also robbed them spiritually by stealing from them the opportunity to come to know God genuinely.&#8221; In many ways it&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.unchristian.com/pdfs/Too_Political.pdf">right wing co-opting religion that is a major factor in young generations ditching Christianity</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;If we’re honest, most of us would accept that a bad boss is a little bit like a bad father or a bad husband … you find that he tends to do more good than harm. He might be a bad boss but at least he’s employing someone while he is in fact a boss.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On abortion:</p>

<blockquote><p> ‘The problem with the Australian practice of abortion is that an objectively grave matter has been reduced to a question of the mother’s convenience.&#8221;</p>

<p> “If half the effort were put into discouraging teenage promiscuity as goes into preventing teenage speeding, there might be fewer abortions, fewer traumatised young women and fewer dysfunctional families.”</p>

<p> “Why isn’t the fact that 100,000 women choose to end their pregnancies regarded as a national tragedy approaching the scale, say, of Aboriginal life expectancy being 20 years less than that of the general community?”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;In Australia, as elsewhere, one of the great totems of liberation from authority has been abortion on demand. Spurred by pictures of 12-week-old unborn babies being dismembered, some women’s activists have started to question the abortion culture. Abortion may not be the precise moral equivalent of infanticide but it’s not just removing an inconvenient wart or cyst either.<br/>
Since 1996, contrary to poltical correctness, the Australian parliament has overturned right-to-kill laws and (almost) banned gay marriage. Perhaps a political constituency may even be starting to emerge to ban abortions after 20 weeks. Thoughtful feminists are starting to grieve over the downstream consequences of sexual freedom.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

    <link href="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2013/01/30/django-unchained/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-30T07:05:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2013/01/30/django-unchained</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Quentin Tarantino&#8217;s latest spaghetti western and blaxploitation inspired film. QT takes on the brutality of the slave culture in the antebellum South as he did the Holocaust in <strong>Inglorious Basterds</strong>. Christoph Waltz played a German in both films, giving a much more convincing performance in Django as Dr Shultz, a bounty hunter who hates slavers. Through his partnership with freed slave Django (Jamie Foxx) they go on a blood soaked rampage for justice and vengeance. Ebert calls the ending a &#8220;satisfactory Quentonian celebration of violence&#8221;. Django has been criticised for excessive on-screen violence and a release date two weeks from the Conneticuit mass murder. Of course this is a <a href="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2013/01/20/rick-perry/">standard diversionary tactic against real political action</a>. QT&#8217;s use of grindhouse storytelling leaves moralisers in a panic and fans and critics expressing strong approval in a measured fashion. Tarantino has also come under fire for the script&#8217;s frequent use of the n-word, which <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-jamie-foxx-django-unchained-n-word-leonardo-dicaprio-20121220,0,2556146.story">the actors found uncomfortable</a>. QT tackles the heavy subject of slavery without succumbing to moralising, creating entertainment (with unexpectedly humorous scenes) for a wide audience. And in some ways, that&#8217;s probably why conservatives hate it.</p>

<p>Throughout film history audiences have been influenced by abridged accounts of historical events. Discussing <strong>Battleship Potemkin</strong>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battleship_Potemkin#The_Odessa_Steps_sequence">Roger Ebert writes</a>,</p>

<blockquote><p>That there was, in fact, no czarist massacre on the Odessa Steps scarcely diminishes the power of the scene &#8230; It is ironic that [Eisenstein] did it so well that today, the bloodshed on the Odessa steps is often referred to as if it really happened.</p></blockquote>

<p>There&#8217;s been a strong critic reaction to <strong>Zero Dark Thirty</strong> with its positive portrayal of &#8220;enhanced interrogation techniques&#8221;, with an ex-CIA official calling the movie <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2013/jan/14/oscars-boycott-zero-dark-thirty">an &#8220;infomercial&#8221; for their techniques</a>. The film does not explicitly say that torture helped to gain information to capture Bin Laden, it only makes that suggestion by designating half an hour at the start of the film to interrogations. Even people who know that no information was gained on Bin Laden through torture, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/01/zero-dark-thirty-debate-torture-has-no-place-in-a-civilized-society/">presenting it as a standard part of a modern intelligence operation is morally dubious</a>.</p>

<p>The history shows not only did torture fail to produce useful information other than what was already gained without using &#8220;enhanced&#8221; techniques, faulty information <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/23/opinion/la-oe-1223-mcdermott-torture-bigelow-zero-dark-20121223">sent the CIA on a wild goose chase</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The simple fact is you can&#8217;t reliably separate the gold from the dross that torture yields. &#8220;He had us chasing the goddamn geese in Central Park because he said some of them had explosives stuffed up their ass,&#8221; one FBI counter-terrorism agent said in frustration</p></blockquote>

<p>Audiences of historical fiction should be mindful that the presentation of events they see may have little to do with actual history. When one of Django&#8217;s characters, the ugly, sadistic Big John Brittle starts whipping a black slave girl for breaking eggs while holding a bible in his left hand and recounting scripture, I was dubious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction#Jules.27s_Bible_passage">given Tarantino&#8217;s history of making up bible passages</a>. Lo and behold, the text of the bible passage is accurate, Genesis 9:2 &#8220;The fear of ye, and the dread of ye, shall be on every beast of the Earth&#8221;. Some have questioned whether Tarantino, an atheist, is laying it on a bit thick by with Brittle having three pages from the bible sewn to his clothes while being an outlaw wanted dead or alive.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/dj-145.jpeg" title="Big John Brittle shot in Django Unchained" ></p>

<p>But really, considering the context, this isn&#8217;t pantomime at all. Students of the pseudoscience of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology">phrenology</a> considered the brains of Europeans the &#8220;most beautiful&#8221; when compared to &#8220;lesser&#8221; races, as blacks lacked the part of the brain capable of producing artists. Considering Genesis 9, the biblical account of the result of Yahweh&#8217;s global flood is that the world must be repopulated from Noah&#8217;s descendents, Shem, Ham and Japeth.</p>

<blockquote><p> Noah, a man of the soil, began to plant a vineyard. <em>21</em> When he drank some of the wine, he got drunk and uncovered himself inside his tent. <em>22</em> Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father&#8217;s nakedness and told his two brothers who were outside. <em>23</em> Shem and Japheth took the garment and placed it on their shoulders. Then they walked in backwards and covered up their father&#8217;s nakedness. Their faces were turned the other way so they did not see their father&#8217;s nakedness.</p>

<p> 24 When Noah awoke from his drunken stupor he learned what his youngest son had done to him. 25 So he said,</p>

<p> &#8220;Cursed be Canaan!<br/>
 The lowest of slaves<br/>
 he will be to his brothers.&#8221; <br/>
 26 He also said,</p>

<p> &#8220;Worthy of praise is the LORD, the God of Shem! <br/>
 May Canaan be the slave of Shem!<br/>
 27 May God enlarge Japheth&#8217;s territory and numbers!<br/>
 May he live in the tents of Shem <br/>
 and may Canaan be his slave!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>And so because Ham didn&#8217;t cover up his father&#8217;s nakedness, instead left his father&#8217;s tent to tell his brothers and laugh at his father (and possibly bring out Noah&#8217;s garment to show his brothers, before they honourably bring back &#8220;the garment&#8221;) all of Ham&#8217;s descendants are cursed to be the <strong>עֶבֶד עֲבָדִים eved avadim</strong>, the lowest of slaves. The curse is pronounced on Canaan, not Ham.</p>

<p>While Genesis 9 only mentiones the Canaanites (Phoenecia/Palestine) as the people group under the curse of slavery from Ham, Genesis 10:6 also mentions the Cush (Nubia/Ethiopia), Mizraim (Egypt) and Put (Libya). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Ham">Traditional Christian understanding asserts that Japheth went on to father the people group that became Western Europeans and Caucasians</a>. Therefore this simplistic literal understanding of Genesis has been used for generations to support the idea that black people were under a curse from God to serve the white people as slaves. Unfortunately this is <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/texas-public-school-course-teaches-racial-origins-traced-noah">still being taught as gospel in Southern public schools</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/RacialOriginsNoah.jpg" title="Racial Origins from Noah's Decendents" ></p>

<p>The belief that African people are born to serve Caucasians as the &#8216;lowest of slaves&#8217; is alive and well in Texas. How do these types respond to the film? <a href="http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2012/12/12/the-conservative-backlash-against-django-unchained-began-today">With widespread admiration, of course</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Django Unchained is hard-core Cultural Marxism. Supporters of this doctrine believe that the best way to get the American public to accept Marxism and Totalitarianism is to denigrate, defame, and ridicule Western Civilization, moral values, Christianity, and the family unit. It was devised by the Frankfurt School in the 1930s.</p>

<p>The movie is being released on Christmas Day as a way of denigrating Christmas and the Christian faith.</p>

<p>Jamie Foxx, the star of Django Unchained is promoting the movie by going on anti-white racial rants in public. This weekend, on Saturday Night Live, he stated “I get to kill all the white people, how great is that!”</p></blockquote>

<p>Other than slavery being banned in the South, the only thing that seems to have changed is that now they have to call heroic black figures &#8216;socialist&#8217; when in public. I bet they&#8217;ll love the next 4 years.</p>

    <link href="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2013/01/22/dickson-women/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-22T18:55:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2013/01/22/dickson-women</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>John Dickson&#8217;s <a href="http://sydneyanglicans.net/blogs/culture/a-surprising-consensus">stirring up some trouble by suggesting that women should be allowed to preach in church</a>. The idea that evangelicals are still discussing this in the 21st centuary is patently ridiculous, but Dickson is stepping in to offer a biblical basis for letting women preach modern sermons without becoming priests. His argument is that if Paul&#8217;s prohibition on permitting women to teach men authoritatively does not prohibit exortation or prophesy. The word &#8216;didaskos&#8217; (from learning, as in autodidact) is used by Paul with high specificity of &#8216;guarding the apostolic deposit&#8217;, therefore it is unclear what level of teaching women are prevented from performing. The crux is that most modern sermons have some teaching and some exhortation. Michael Jensen warns against &#8216;theologising our traditions&#8217;, but the book has provoked a small backlash (more of a whimper than a bang).</p>

<p>When Johannes Gutenberg created the printing press he had many things to say about its ability to spread orthodoxy thoughout the world.</p>

<blockquote><p>It is a press, certainly, but a press from which shall flow in inexhaustible streams&#8230;Through it, God will spread His Word. A spring of truth shall flow from it: like a new star it shall scatter the darkness of ignorance, and cause a light heretofore unknown to shine amongst men.</p>

<p>God suffers in the multitude of souls whom His word can not reach. Religious truth is imprisoned in a small number of manuscript books which confine instead of spread the public treasure. Let us break the seal which seals up holy things and give wings to Truth in order that she may win every soul that comes into the world by her word no longer written at great expense by hands easily palsied, but multiplied like the wind by an untiring machine.</p></blockquote>

<p>The printing press wasn&#8217;t just used to print bibles, it was used to print <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/274/pg274.html">Luther&#8217;s 95 Theses</a>. What was thesis 90?</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>To repress these arguments and scruples of the laity by force alone, and not to resolve them by giving reasons, is to expose the Church and the pope to the ridicule of their enemies, and to make Christians unhappy.</li>

<p>And how do people <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T1RLYJM4U3TV">respond to John Dickson</a>?</p>

<blockquote><p>This book does not line up with scriptural truth, so that is why I give it the lowest rating. I would say it is full of &#8220;thumb sucking theology&#8221; - where the writer &#8220;sucks it out of his thumb&#8221; because he has to; there is not sound biblical support for his view. Reject this. Discard it, no matter how well it might be written.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some others have suggested that the layity should not be allowed to have access to the secret knowledge of Greek and Hebrew, because, then how will they understand English words in their bible? This painfully naive argument overlooks the reality of changing communications technology and how that will inevitably change the way the laity interacts with the church. It also ignores that bible translations satisfy a political agenda - case in point, the KJV has only 2 instances of the word &#8216;slave&#8217;</p>

<p>In fact, King James <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorized_King_James_Version#Considerations_for_a_new_version">authorised his version because he found the marginal notes in the Geneva translation offensive</a>, praising the civil disobedience of the Hebrew midwives in Exodus 1:19. The king also gave the translators instructions designed to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology of the Church of England.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like what this author has to say so I don&#8217;t want anyone to read it&#8221; stopped working in 1517, but evangelicals keep trying these counterproductive &#8221;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-latondresse/farewell-rob-bell-or-john_b_829409.html">Farewell, Rob Bell</a>&#8221; hatchet jobs.</p>

<blockquote><p>Rob Bell now stands alongside a growing pantheon of brothers in Christ &#8211; Greg Boyd, Brian McLaren and N.T. Wright among them &#8211; who Piper has thrown under the bus (and even called &#8220;heretics&#8221;) simply because their theology doesn&#8217;t neatly jibe with his own.</p>

<p>For a generation harboring increasingly negative perceptions about (and distancing itself from) Christianity, there&#8217;s no question that controversies like these have played a big role in making these trends worse. When asked to describe present-day Christianity, the second most reported description of young people (ages 16 to 29) was that it is &#8220;too-judgmental,&#8221; with 87 percent of young non-churchgoers and 52 percent of churchgoers holding this view.</p></blockquote>

<p>When Rachel Held evans was writing a book on feminism, <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/on-rachel-held-evans-and-why-vagina-gate-matters/">she was asked to drop the two references to the word vagina to appease Lifeway</a>. Lifeway are the bookstore arm of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention">Southern Baptist Convention, an evangelical group set up over slave-holding rights</a>, so good luck publishing a book saying that if Christians don&#8217;t take stoning non-virgins to death on their wedding night seriously, maybe <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/unreasonablefaith/2011/07/thoughts-on-driscoll/">dumb ideas about women baking</a> <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2013/01/mark-driscoll-on-stay-at-home-dads.html">need to die out</a> <a href="http://www.nakedpastor.com/2012/01/17/mark-driscoll-in-hell/">as well</a>. Despite the book not being listed by lifeway, A Year of Biblical Womanhood made it onto the <a href="http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/why-a-year-of-biblical-womanhood-is-a-nyt-bestseller">New York Times top 18th e-book bestseller</a>. A clear victory for vaginas everywhere, and a defeat for those that want to censor Christianity into decrepitude with outdated ideas about book buying.</p>

<p>The saddest thing about the issue is how much Dickson is not saying. What&#8217;s it going to be, another 10 years of Sydney Anglicans dragging their feet on women in any real ministry roles? Yes, that&#8217;s right, I said real; get used to it. If you can&#8217;t confront the reality that the current situation is actually shitty for women you won&#8217;t be able to confront the reality that Sydney Anglicans will be a <a href="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2012/12/07/ncls2011">vestige of its former glory</a>. And I&#8217;m not sure what to think about it.</p>

    <updated>2013-01-20T15:35:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2013/01/20/rick-perry</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rick Perry, governer of Texas has come out against gun control, suggesting to Christians that <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/50484736/ns/local_news-dallas_fort_worth_tx/t/gov-rick-perry-responds-obama-gun-control-order/#.UPkB8dc-vZg">prayer works better than gun control</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p> Guns require a finger to pull the trigger. The sad young man who did that in Newtown was clearly haunted by demons and no gun law could have saved the children in Sandy Hook Elementary from his terror.</p>

<p> There is evil prowling in the world – it shows up in our movies, video games and online fascinations, and finds its way into vulnerable hearts and minds. As a free people, let us choose what kind of people we will be.  Laws, the only redoubt of secularism, will not suffice.  Let us all return to our places of worship and pray for help. Above all, let us pray for our children.</p>

<p> In fact, the piling on by the political left, and their cohorts in the media, to use the massacre of little children to advance a pre-existing political agenda that would not have saved those children, disgusts me, personally.  The second amendment to the Constitution is a basic right of free people and cannot be nor will it be abridged by the executive power of this or any other president.</p></blockquote>

<p>Perry claims that &#8220;no gun law could have saved the children in Sandy Hook Elementary from his terror&#8221;. Even if the killer Lanza was possessed by a demon, gun laws do indeed save lives. On the same day as the Sandy Hook killings, a mentally ill man in the Chinese provence of Guanxi <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/15/not-just-sandy-hook-china-s-terrifying-knife-attacks.html">wounded 22 children in a school stabbing rampage</a>. All of the children survived. To say that gun laws have no effect is nonsense, and the Chinese example proves that it is easier to eliminate firearms in a society than mental health issues.</p>

<p>If Rick Perry believes that laws are a &#8220;redoubt of secularism&#8221; then we must ask, what is the function of the governor of a state other than to create laws to make her citizens safe and prosperous? If it is to call citizens to &#8220;pray for help&#8221;, I think he&#8217;s confused the state for the church. A common mistake among born-again Christians these days.</p>

<p>To blame a lack of prayer reliance on God for these tragedies is a slap in the face of the victims and their families who attended church before or after the shooting. In fact, religion may be more a part of the <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/death-violence-and-america-is-god-the-answer-or-the-problem/">problem of violence than the solution</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>When American Christians are more supportive of weapons, war and torture than their unbelieving neighbors, something has gone terribly wrong. When the greatest amount of violence is found precisely in the region of the country where church membership and attendance is the highest we might ask what kind of influence Christians are exerting. Complaints about a lack of official prayer in schools or an absence of religious symbols in the public square don’t get even close to identifying the source of the violence problem.</p></blockquote>

<p>Rather than discussing real solutions to mental health issues, Perry goes on to blame the entertainment industry and &#8220;evil prowling in the world&#8221;. Violent video games and movies have long been criticized for inspiring murders. After the 1999 mass murder in Columbine, Franklin Graham commented that the <a href="http://extras.denverpost.com/news/chs0416p.htm">tragedy has strengthened his belief that guns aren&#8217;t to blame for gun violence</a>. Rather, Graham said that the entertainment industry is &#8220;awash in killings, shootings and rapes. We are complete fools if we don&#8217;t think that today&#8217;s entertainment has poisoned a generation. I&#8217;ve always believed this but I believe it more now.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is a smattering of research showing a tenuous correlation between violent media and anti-social behaviour, but there is no proof of causation. Given that the entertainment industry has most of their products protected under free speech rights in the First Amendment to the US Constitution, it&#8217;s dissapointing that the governor has not sought genuine solutions 13 years on.</p>

<p>The abuse of religion by the far right in America is a phenomenon that is drawing more and more negative attention. When evangelical leaders called school shootings <a href="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2013/01/03/rentier-theology/">god&#8217;s will</a> many Christians cautiously distance themselves. Unfortunately while some have downplayed the significance of <a href="http://www.outofur.com/archives/2013/01/no_were_not_a_h.html">a few &#8220;crazy uncles&#8221; and insist that mainstream Christianity is not a hate group</a>, Perry joining the chorus is not going to help.</p>

<p>Albert Mohler described the Republican loss of the 2012 presidential race as an &#8221;<a href="http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/real-evangelical-disaster">evangelical disaster</a>&#8221;. Rachel Held Evans responded that &#8220;the great evangelical disaster is that evangelicalism has become synonymous with Republicanism rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ.&#8221; Gun control measures like <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2013/01/14/in-gun-control-debate-several-options-draw-majority-support/">universal background checks supported by 85% of Republicans</a>. I&#8217;d say that the real disaster is that evangelicalism is being used as an excuse, or worse, as a justification to push political inaction on something the majority of the country wants because the NRA is lining their pockets. If Christians don&#8217;t change their trajectory, I don&#8217;t think there will be much of a church left in another 13 years. And the only explanation they&#8217;ll have for it is to blame violent video games for &#8220;corrupting the youth&#8221;.</p>

<div class="youtube-lazy-link-info">Fischer: Natural Disasters Are God&#8217;s Spankings</div>
</a>
<div class="video-info" >http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/fischer-natural-disasters-are-gods-spankings

Bryan Fischer explains that natural disasters are God&#8217;s way of getting our attention and correcting us, like chidlren who need a spaking.</div>
</div>


<p>I guess someone had better tell Jesus, he seems to have gotten his theology wrong in Luke 13:</p>

<blockquote><p>There were some present at that very time who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. <em>2</em> And he answered them, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered in this way? <em>3</em> No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. <em>4</em> Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them: do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in Jerusalem? <em>5</em> No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.”</p></blockquote>

<p>With Cindy Jacobs getting new prophesy all the time, of course Jesus would need to update some of his more old hat ideas. And Fisher should probably tell Job who seems to make a fuss about his friends rightly criticising him for his slapping:</p>

<blockquote><p> 2 &#8220;I have heard many things like these before.   <br/>
 What miserable comforters are you all! <br/>
 3 Will there be an end to your windy words?<br/>
 Or what provokes you that you answer?  <br/>
 4 I also could speak like you, <br/>
 if you were in my place; <br/>
 I could pile up words against you <br/>
 and I could shake my head at you. <br/>
 5 But I would strengthen you with my words; <br/>
 comfort from my lips would bring you relief.</p></blockquote>

<p>What a whiny peter pan man-boy. He must not have been given enough discipline in public schools, now all he has is an entitlement culture. Guess we&#8217;ll just have to write off the mind of another youth after the softness of &#8216;developmental psychology&#8217; turned it to much. We see this with his complete disrespect for the scriptural knowledge of his betters</p>

<blockquote><p> Job 15:8: Do you listen in on God&#8217;s secret council? Do you limit wisdom to yourself? <br/>
 Job 15:9: What do you know that we don&#8217;t know? What do you understand that we don&#8217;t understand? <br/>
 Job 15:10: The gray-haired and the aged are on our side, men far older than your father. <br/>
 Job 15:11: Are God&#8217;s consolations too trivial for you; or a word spoken in gentleness to you?</p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately &#8220;sin inspires his mouth; he chooses the language of the crafty&#8221; because he just wants to sin and do whatever he wants, just like a standard drug-addled liberal. Of course he doesn&#8217;t recognise God&#8217;s wisdom when we give it to him.</p>

<p>Now there is a liberal hoax that <strong>claims</strong> that this man is &#8220;blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil&#8221;. But really, have you seen the <em>long form</em> of his birth certificate? I didn&#8217;t think so. Stick it on the pile with climate change, heliocentrism and the germ theory of disease. Pfft, those scientists and their <strong>theories</strong>. You can&#8217;t trust theories when it comes to life and death.</p>

<p>Similarly someone should tell Yahweh as well (just in case Jesus forgot to pass it on to himself) - clearly God was meant to punish Job, not the miserable comforters that rightly point out Job&#8217;s sin causing all these natural disasters to be brought on himself. Their message might not be popular, but it sure is &#8216;biblical&#8217; (in a sense), and they should be praised for preaching it boldly.</p>

<blockquote><p> Job 42:7: After the LORD had spoken these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, &#8220;My anger is stirred up against you and your two friends, because you have not spoken about me what is right, as my servant Job has.<br/>
 Job 42:8: So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and offer a burnt offering for yourselves. And my servant Job will intercede for you, and I will respect him, so that I do not deal with you according to your folly, because you have not spoken about me what is right, as my servant Job has.&#8221; <br/>
 Job 42:9: So they went, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and did just as the LORD had told them; and the LORD had respect for Job.</p></blockquote>

<p>Geez, this socialist seems to be engaging in class warfare.</p>

    <link href="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2013/01/03/rentier-theology/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-03T19:10:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2013/01/03/rentier-theology</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s common to hear right wing editorials and chain letters advancing arguments to the effect that if society only did X (like they did in the &#8220;good old days&#8221;) then every social ill would be cured. This commonly plays on misconceptions based on alarmist media reports that <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/150464/Americans-Believe-Crime-Worsening.aspx">violence in Western societies is getting worse</a> while in reality violent crime <a href="http://edge.org/conversation/mc2011-history-violence-pinker">is at the lowest levels ever thoughout the West</a>.</p>

<p>Many people think that <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2012/s3511023.htm">crime in the Australia is worsening</a>, and that the majority of crime involves violence. Unfortunately, the media frequently presents <a href="http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/Lawlink/bocsar/ll_bocsar.nsf/vwFiles/CJB153.pdf/$file/CJB153.pdf">misleading commentary on crime figures</a>, suggesting that small localised variations in crime rates are indicitive of a trend towards mayhem and chaos. This has lead to an evaporation of public confidence in the <a href="http://aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/tandi/381-400/tandi387/view%20paper.html">ability for the criminal justice system to deal with crime fairly and adequately</a>. A study of Tasmanian jurors found that while 80% of the public believe that courts are too lenient in sentencing, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/1128_aic.pdf">90% of of jurors informed on information about crime cases thought that the judge in the case gave an adequate sentence</a>.</p>

<p>Despite the reality that courts are generally in line with Australian expectations on crime sentencing, misinformed conservatives are pushing in various states for mandatory minimum sentences, based on the idea that politicians, pundits and focus groups know more about how to deal with crime than lawyers, academics and judges. These policies would <a href="http://newmatilda.com/2012/07/13/campbells-tick-and-flick-government">dramatically increase the prison population</a>, putting pressure on the public corrections system to build more prisons. Private prison companies would likely be commissioned to increase prisons capacity at lower cost. But as <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/08/private_prisons">The Economist warns</a>, &#8220;The great hazard of contracting out incarceration &#8220;services&#8221; is that private firms may well turn out to be even more efficient and effective than unions in lobbying for policies that would increase prison populations.&#8221;</p>

<p>This has indeed happend in America, not just with prisons lobbying government to maintain &#8220;demand&#8221; for their services, but directly <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/06/matt-stoller-who-wants-keep-the-war-on-drugs-going-and-put-you-in-debtors-prison.html">bribing judges to increase the sentences for offenders</a>. The for profit prisons industry is concerned that &#8220;any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them.&#8221; They also list good policing as a risk to their business: &#8220;reductions in crime rates or resources dedicated to prevent and enforce crime could lead to reductions in arrests, convictions and sentences requiring incarceration at correctional facilities.&#8221; As the saying goes, if you&#8217;re not part of the solution, prolong the problem for as long as possible.</p>

<p>The next time you hear a conservative pundit decrying the &#8220;softness&#8221; of judges and insisting on &#8220;tough on crime&#8221; policies you should ask yourself: &#8220;is this supported by the evidence?&#8221; And if not, what&#8217;s behind this? Who benefits? Is it simply incompetence or is it malice? Is it just yellow journalism to sell tabloids or is there an economic incentive in perpetuating the misinformation that violent crime is on the rise, or that current drug policy is working?</p>

<p>Often those pushing a conservative moral argument <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootleggers_and_Baptists">have no idea where their financial backing comes from</a>. Politics makes for strange bedfellows, with polticians often acting as a go-between with conservative moralisers and those with a financial agenda. During the prohibition era, Baptists were known to ally in their support of alcohol bans with bootleggers that profited from them. The preachers wanted to ban alcohol so that church wouldn&#8217;t compete with pubs on the &#8220;Lord&#8217;s day&#8221;. The bootleggers wanted their monopoly on the sale of alcohol. It leads to faulty theology like this, a billboard encouraging voters in a dry town not to legalise the sale of alcohol, saying that a vote for legal alcohol is a re-crucifixion of Jesus.
<img src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/BaptistsAndBootleggers.jpg" title="Baptists and Bootleggers" alt="Baptists and Bootleggers" /></p>

<p>A minor problem with this sign is that it&#8217;s not only hysterical, it&#8217;s completely unbiblical. The sign references Hebrews 10:29, which warns that church-goers who &#8220;deliberately keep on sinning&#8221; can be guilty of re-crucifying Jesus drink communion wine in an unworthy manner (&#8220;profaning the blood of the covenant&#8221;). To say that this prohibits the sale of alcohol for non-religious consumption is a misapplication of scripture. Most Christian denominations support the moderate consumption of alcohol (but condemn drunkenness). Jesus turned water into wine at a wedding party, and Ecclesiastes 9:7 instructs, “Drink your wine with a merry heart.” Psalm 104:14-15 states that God gives wine “that makes glad the heart of men.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately many who want to push Christian morality into government policy end up pushing their own brand of legalism. And the Christian leaders most willing to publicise an unbiblical message are likely to be the ones lacking the moral scrupules or common sense to question where the money for their campaign comes from.</p>

<p>Exactly the same tends to happen with the <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/abortion-politically-decisive-christians-election-sin/">emotionally charged abortion rights debate</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, the abortion issue has allowed many Christians – and conservatives as a whole – to claim to be working to defend the most vulnerable when in fact they are turning attention and national resources away from those who are most desperately in need. The good that actually could be done to protect life isn’t done because pro-life Christians lend their support to politicians who are most likely to block funding for programs for children and families of the weakest and most impoverished. The abortion issue ends up serving as a smokescreen behind which certain politicians work in the interests of those who are the most rich and powerful.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many have examined the positions they took in <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2012/10/how-i-lost-faith-in-the-pro-life-movement.html">the pro-life movement and found them be factually bankrupt on closer inspection</a>.</p>

<p>When over 20 kindergarten students were killed in a mass shooting in Newtown, Conneticuit, many evangelical leaders expressed a belief that the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/17/james-dobson-connecticut-shooting-gay-marriage_n_2318015.html">tragedy was a result of God&#8217;s will</a>. James Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family had this to say about the cause of the shooting:</p>

<blockquote><p>We have turned our back on God. millions of people have decided that God doesn&#8217;t exist, or he&#8217;s irrelevant to me and we have killed 54 million babies and the institution of marriage is right on the verge of a complete redefinition. Believe me, that is going to have consequences, too&#8230;
I think we have turned our back on the Scripture and on God Almighty and I think he has allowed judgment to fall upon us. I think that’s what is going on.</p></blockquote>

<p>Bryan Fischer, host of a popular American Family Association radio show, said on Friday that God did not protect the Sandy Hook&#8217;s victims because prayer had been kicked out of public school in the &#8217;60s. Former GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said Americans should not be surprised at the tragedy because &#8220;we have sytematically removed God from our schools.&#8221;</p>

<p>Franklin Graham, the son of Billy Graham and the CEO of the Samaritan&#8217;s Purse charity said that Americans &#8220;shouldn&#8217;t be shocked&#8221; at the mass murder because of violent video games and that God has been &#8220;removed&#8221; from public schools.</p>

</a>

Franklin Graham blames the Sandy Hook massacre on television, music, video games, and the removal of God from public school.</div>
</div>


<p>Sam Morris, a Tennessee pastor believes the shootings are the result of schools teaching that &#8220;humanism&#8221; means that students are God and Lanza, the serial killer &#8220;can just go blow up anybody he wants&#8221;. He also said they teach <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/12/17/tennessee-pastor-mass-shootings-because-schools-teach-evolution-and-how-to-be-a-homo/">evolution and &#8220;how to be a homo&#8221;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>when you kicked God out of schools, you’re going to be judged for that.</p>

<p>When I got in high school, man, I started learning all this kingdom, phylum stuff, all this junk about evolution&#8230; evolution teaches — here’s the bottom line — that you’re an animal&#8230;</p>

<p>So, here you are, you’re an animal and you’re a god! So, what are we going to teach you about in school? Well, we can teach you about sex, we can teach you how to rebel to you parents, we can teach you how to be a homo! But we’re definitely not going to teach you about the word of God! Amen.</p></blockquote>

<p>Blaming school shootings on God, the devil or secularism has been going on for as long as school shootings in America. After the Columbine tragedy, the father of one of the deceased had the poor judgement to state &#8220;Columbine was not just a tragedy &#8211; it was a spiritual event&#8221; After hurricane Katrina struck, Billy Graham&#8217;s daughter remarked &#8220;we&#8217;ve been telling God to get out of our schools, to get out of our government and to get out of our lives. And being the gentleman He is, I believe He has calmly backed out.&#8221; In fact, you can be sure that Christians have been saying that &#8220;God is a gentleman&#8221; since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Siloam">tower of Siloam fell</a>.</p>

<p>A number of Christians have commented on the <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/sandy-hook-and-the-tearing-asunder-of-evangelical-christianity/">right wing fundamentalists that now control evangelical Christianity and their theology</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>To blame a lack of reliance on God for this most recent tragedy is a slap in the face of the victims and their families who attended church before or after the shooting&#8230; If Christians want to place blame, blame the culture of violence—not the Prince of Peace</p>

<p>We do not need the government forcing us to say officially-sanctioned prayers in school each day.  Do we think being forced to say a prayer is any prayer at all?  Do we think that in the not-so-distant days of Christendom, when all members of society were considered “Christian” and our nations were “Christian,” that faith was genuine? We have come so far and need to respect the rights of other religious traditions.  We argue for freedom for our missionaries to evangelize in Islamic countries but then we want to remake America in their same restrictive mold.  Sure, today, our faith is sometimes looked down upon, marginalized, and spat on—but the church is in a much better place now that we have regained the pre-Constantinian role of sojourners in a sinful world rather than the inquisitors of godless governments.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many Christian leaders are also pointing out that ultimately the arguments about school prayer and God&#8217;s will are designed to <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/death-violence-and-america-is-god-the-answer-or-the-problem/">take attention away from the discourse about effective regulations to prevent future tragedies</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>When American Christians are more supportive of weapons, war and torture than their unbelieving neighbors, something has gone terribly wrong. When the greatest amount of violence is found precisely in the region of the country where church membership and attendance is the highest we might ask what kind of influence Christians are exerting. Complaints about a lack of official prayer in schools or an absence of religious symbols in the public square don’t get even close to identifying the source of the violence problem.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s common to see specious arguments claiming to know the mind of God being forwarded by hayseeders who don&#8217;t understand the interests co-opting their agenda. These stooges frustratingly lack the ability to ask simple questions like, &#8216;Is this biblical?&#8217; or &#8216;who benefits?&#8217;. Younger Christians that question the political rhetoric of the evangelical churches they find themselves in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-d-mclaren/why-do-evangelicals-disli_b_517094.html">remain quiet about it, fearing ostracization</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many are afraid to admit that they voted for Barack Obama, or believe in evolution, or are concerned about global climate change, or are OK with their friends being gay or priests being married, or use birth control, or wish women could be treated as equals in their church, or don&#8217;t take every word of the Bible as having equal authority and historical accuracy. If they speak up, they will be shunned by their religious authorities &#8211; and zapped by their fellow Christians who have been told to press the punishment button when anyone dares to differ by giving the &#8220;wrong&#8221; answer. So they comply.</p></blockquote>

<p>They comply until the evangelicals pushing an increasingly overt right wing political agenda give them more and more reasons to leave.</p>

    <link href="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2012/12/23/columbine-mani/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-23T17:04:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2012/12/23/columbine-mani</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another idiotic message is floating around on Facebook, explaining shootings as God&#8217;s will. I could point out everything wrong with it, but don&#8217;t have the time or patience. Fundamentally it falls for the Manichean mistake of assuming that the world is made up of light and shadow, and that there are no morally gray areas. The simplistic and childish argument basically follows that since everyone who goes to church is a &#8220;good guy&#8221;, that the government doesn&#8217;t need to restrict firearms to reduce homicides and mass murders, but instead needs to &#8220;church&#8221; the &#8220;bad guys&#8221;, because Christianity is a solution to everything, not <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/death-violence-and-america-is-god-the-answer-or-the-problem/">part of the problem</a>.
The Facebook message goes like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Scott, the father of Rachel Scott, a victim of the Columbine High School shootings in Littleton, Colorado, was invited to address the House Judiciary Committee&#8217;s subcommittee. What he said to our national leaders during this special session of Congress was painfully truthful.
They were not prepared for what he was to say, nor was it received well. It needs to be heard by every parent, every teacher, every politician, every sociologist, every psychologist, and every so-called expert! These courageous words spoken by Darrell Scott are powerful, penetrating, and deeply personal. There is no doubt that God sent this man as a voice crying in the wilderness. The following is a portion of the transcript:</p>

<p>&#8220;Since the dawn of creation there has been both good &amp;evil in the hearts of men and women. We all contain the seeds of kindness or the seeds of violence. The death of my wonderful daughter, Rachel Joy Scott, and the deaths of that heroic teacher, and the other eleven children who died must not be in vain. Their blood cries out for answers.
&#8220;The first recorded act of violence was when Cain slew his brother Abel out in the field. The villain was not the club he used.. Neither was it the NCA, the National Club Association. The true killer was Cain, and the reason for the murder could only be found in Cain&#8217;s heart.</p></blockquote>

<p>It goes without saying that clubs require tedious effort to kill one person, whereas the killers in Columbine and Sandy Hook used semi automatic assault rifles with 30 round magazines and 100 round drums. It also goes without saying that Christians sin all the time, and are meant to throw off the &#8220;rags&#8221; of sin that still &#8220;cling&#8221; to them despite their religious observance. This pointless &#8220;people kill people&#8221; argument overlooks that <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/182243551.html">4 year olds can kill 2 year olds by mishandling firearms</a>. It overlooks that in China a crazy man stabbing 20 school children killed none of them. Eliminating violence will never be achievable, while restricting access to firearms is substantially easier than pro gun advocates will admit.</p>

<p>This excellent article <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/sandy-hook-and-the-tearing-asunder-of-evangelical-christianity/">destroys most of the rest of this nonsense</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>To blame a lack of reliance on God for this most recent tragedy is a slap in the face of the victims and their families who attended church before or after the shooting&#8230; If Christians want to place blame, blame the culture of violence—not the Prince of Peace</p>

<p>We do not need the government forcing us to say officially-sanctioned prayers in school each day.  Do we think being forced to say a prayer is any prayer at all?  Do we think that in the not-so-distant days of Christendom, when all members of society were considered “Christian” and our nations were “Christian,” that faith was genuine? We have come so far and need to respect the rights of other religious traditions.  We argue for freedom for our missionaries to evangelize in Islamic countries but then we want to remake America in their same restrictive mold.  Sure, today, our faith is sometimes looked down upon, marginalized, and spat on—but the church is in a much better place now that we have regained the pre-Constantinian role of sojourners in a sinful world rather than the inquisitors of godless governments.</p></blockquote>

<p>The rest of the specious bullshit follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;In the days that followed the Columbine tragedy, I was amazed at how quickly fingers began to be pointed at groups such as the NRA. I am not a member of the NRA. I am not a hunter. I do not even own a gun. I am not here to represent or defend the NRA - because I don&#8217;t believe that they are responsible for my daughter&#8217;s death. Therefore I do not believe that they need to be defended. If I believed they had anything to do with Rachel&#8217;s murder I would be their strongest opponent
I am here today to declare that Columbine was not just a tragedy &#8211; it was a spiritual event that should be forcing us to look at where the real blame lies! Much of the blame lies here in this room. Much of the blame lies behind the pointing fingers of the accusers themselves. I wrote a poem just four nights ago that expresses my feelings best.</p>

<p>Your laws ignore our deepest needs,
Your words are empty air.
You&#8217;ve stripped away our heritage,
You&#8217;ve outlawed simple prayer.
Now gunshots fill our classrooms,
And precious children die.
You seek for answers everywhere,
And ask the question &#8220;Why?&#8221;
You regulate restrictive laws,
Through legislative creed.
And yet you fail to understand,
That God is what we need!</p>

<p>&#8220;Men and women are three-part beings. We all consist of body, mind, and spirit. When we refuse to acknowledge a third part of our make-up, we create a void that allows evil, prejudice, and hatred to rush in and wreak havoc. Spiritual presences were present within our educational systems for most of our nation&#8217;s history. Many of our major colleges began as theological seminaries. This is a historical fact.
What has happened to us as a nation? We have refused to honor God, and in so doing, we open the doors to hatred and violence. And when something as terrible as Columbine&#8217;s tragedy occurs &#8211; politicians immediately look for a scapegoat such as the NRA. They immediately seek to pass more restrictive laws that contribute to erode away our personal and private liberties. We do not need more restrictive laws.
Eric and Dylan would not have been stopped by metal detectors. No amount of gun laws can stop someone who spends months planning this type of massacre. The real villain lies within our own hearts.</p>

<p>&#8220;As my son Craig lay under that table in the school library and saw his two friends murdered before his very eyes, he did not hesitate to pray in school. I defy any law or politician to deny him that right! I challenge every young person in America , and around the world, to realize that on April 20, 1999, at Columbine High School prayer was brought back to our schools. Do not let the many prayers offered by those students be in vain. Dare to move into the new millennium with a sacred disregard for legislation that violates your God-given right to communicate with Him.</p>

<p>To those of you who would point your finger at the NRA &#8211; I give to you a sincere challenge.. Dare to examine your own heart before casting the first stone!
My daughter&#8217;s death will not be in vain! The young people of this country will not allow that to happen!&#8221;
- Darrell Scott</p>

<p>Do what the media did not - - let the nation hear this man&#8217;s speech. Please share this with your FB friends!</p></blockquote>

    <link href="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2012/12/18/chain-christianity/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-18T19:33:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2012/12/18/chain-christianity</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This bullshit has been going around on Facebook:</p>

<blockquote><p>Very insightful and very true&#8230;.Take a second to read this:</p>

<p>Apparently the White House referred to Christmas Trees as “Holiday Trees” for the first time this year which prompted CBS presenter, Ben Stein, to present this piece which I would like to share with you. I think it applies just as much to many countries as it does to America &#8230;</p>

<p>The following was written by Ben Stein and recited by him on CBS Sunday Morning Commentary.</p>

<p>My confession:</p>

<p>I am a Jew, and every single one of my ancestors was Jewish. And it does not bother me even a little bit when people call those beautiful lit up, bejewelled trees, Christmas trees. I don&#8217;t feel threatened. I don&#8217;t feel discriminated against. That&#8217;s what they are, Christmas trees.</p></blockquote>

<p>Stein loves to wear Judaism on his shoulder, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stein#Dominique_Strauss-Kahn">likening Obama and all proponents of science education as Nazis</a>. Talking about his &#8220;intelligent design&#8221; propaganda movie Stien said &#8220;Love of God and compassion and empathy leads you to a very glorious place, and science leads you to killing people.&#8221; The Anti-Defamation League issued a statement condemning the film&#8217;s misuse of the Holocaust and its imagery, &#8220;Using the Holocaust in order to tarnish those who promote the theory of evolution is outrageous and trivializes the complex factors that led to the mass extermination of European Jewry&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote><p>It doesn&#8217;t bother me a bit when people say, “Merry Christmas” to me. I don&#8217;t think they are slighting me or getting ready to put me in a ghetto. In fact, I kind of like it. It shows that we are all brothers and sisters celebrating this happy time of year. It doesn&#8217;t bother me at all that there is a manger scene on display at a key intersection near my beach house in Malibu. If people want a crib, it&#8217;s just as fine with me as is the Menorah a few hundred yards away.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whether he personally likes Christian imagery in public has no bearing on whether it is constitutional to use government money or government property to put up religious displays.</p>

<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t like getting pushed around for being a Jew, and I don&#8217;t think Christians like getting pushed around for being Christians. I think people who believe in God are sick and tired of getting pushed around, period. I have no idea where the concept came from, that America is an explicitly atheist country. I can&#8217;t find it in the Constitution and I don&#8217;t like it being shoved down my throat.</p></blockquote>

<p>Stein misrepresents the first amendment, which clearly states &#8220;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion&#8221;. This means that public money and public property cannot be used to establish a church, and cannot be used to promote any one religion. That&#8217;s why there are no prayers in US public schools, and no ten commandments in US courthouses.</p>

<blockquote><p>Or maybe I can put it another way: where did the idea come from that we should worship celebrities and we aren&#8217;t allowed to worship God? I guess that&#8217;s a sign that I&#8217;m getting old, too. But there are a lot of us who are wondering where these celebrities came from and where the America we knew went to.</p></blockquote>

<p>Separation of church and state doesn&#8217;t prevent any individual from practicing their religion or worshipping any God. It just means that the government isn&#8217;t allowed to insist to Hindu students that they must worship and Abrahamic God (&#8220;You shall have no other Gods except me&#8221;). The idea that the &#8220;America we knew&#8221; was a better place is a classic argument of conservatives, and is simply false, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect">the highest IQ on average ever</a>, and the <a href="http://edge.org/conversation/mc2011-history-violence-pinker">lowest rates of crime and violence ever</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>In light of the many jokes we send to one another for a laugh, this is a little different: This is not intended to be a joke; it&#8217;s not funny, it&#8217;s intended to get you thinking.</p>

<p>Billy Graham&#8217;s daughter was interviewed on the Early Show and Jane Clayson asked her: “How could God let something like this happen?” (regarding Hurricane Katrina). Anne Graham gave an extremely profound and insightful response. She said: “I believe God is deeply saddened by this, just as we are, but for years we&#8217;ve been telling God to get out of our schools, to get out of our government and to get out of our lives. And being the gentleman He is, I believe He has calmly backed out. How can we expect God to give us His blessing and His protection if we demand He leave us alone?”</p></blockquote>

<p>Jesus makes it clear that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Siloam">tragedy and calamity is not divine retribution</a>. Lotz said exactly the <a href="http://www.prayerfoundation.org/billy_grahams_daughter.htm">same unbiblical shit after 9/11</a>. Bryan Fisher said the same thing after the Conneticuit shooting:</p>

</a>
<div class="video-info" >http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/fischer-god-didnt-stop-ct-school-shooting-because-hes-gentleman-who-doesnt-go-where-he-not-w

Bryan Fischer explains that the massacre at a Connecticut elementary school could have been stopped by God, but he has been kicked out of public schools and doesn&#8217;t go where he is not wanted.</div>
</div>


<blockquote><p>In light of recent events&#8230; terrorists attack, school shootings, etc. I think it started when Madeleine Murray O&#8217;Hare (she was murdered, her body found a few years ago) complained she didn&#8217;t want prayer in our schools, and we said OK. Then someone said you better not read the Bible in school. The Bible says thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, and love your neighbour as yourself. And we said OK.</p></blockquote>

<p>The American government did not say &#8220;OK&#8221; to one woman&#8217;s demands. They followed the US constitution, and removed any material in <em>public</em> schools that would represent an establishment of religion, which forces students to comply with a set religion. Students are allowed to pray in student-initiated prayers, but cannot be directed or compelled to pray by teachers. Teachers are allowed to read from the bible and discuss it as literature in lessons such as history.</p>

<p>One of the key features of a secular system of law and order is that nobody is above the law, it applies equally to all people. That means that a crime committed against someone you don&#8217;t like is a crime, and still deserves justice. When someone you don&#8217;t like is arrested, they still have the right to a fair trial and a legal defence. Murder is murder and will be punished by secular law whether the ten commandments are in schools or courthouses, or not, or the accused or the victim is a religious believer or not. To suggest otherwise suggests delighting in tragedy of people you hate, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_the_other_cheek">you might just remember Jesus preaching against</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Then Dr. Benjamin Spock said we shouldn&#8217;t spank our children when they misbehave, because their little personalities would be warped and we might damage their self-esteem (Dr. Spock&#8217;s son committed suicide). We said an expert should know what he&#8217;s talking about. And we said okay.</p></blockquote>

<p>Pulling out anecdotes of suffering reeks of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude">Schadenfreude</a>, and says nothing about whether the self-esteem movement is useful or not.</p>

<blockquote><p>Now we&#8217;re asking ourselves why our children have no conscience, why they don&#8217;t know right from wrong, and why it doesn&#8217;t bother them to kill strangers, their classmates, and themselves.</p>

<p>Probably, if we think about it long and hard enough, we can figure it out. I think it has a great deal to do with &#8216;WE REAP WHAT WE SOW.&#8217;</p>

<p>Funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world&#8217;s going to hell. Funny how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what the Bible says. Funny how you can send &#8216;jokes&#8217; through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice about sharing. Funny how lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene articles pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion of God is suppressed in the school and workplace.</p></blockquote>

<p>Because unlike what the religious right thinks, &#8220;freedom of religion&#8221; does not mean &#8221;<a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/does-randy-forbes-understand-how-first-amendment-works">nobody is allowed to criticise me</a>&#8221;. Most people who post this kind of content will go through life thinking that most people hate them for their religion. But when Christians go arond with a self-righteous phariseeism trying to criticise, blame and haras anyone who doesn&#8217;t agree with them (including people from their own faith), the real reason they&#8217;re hated is because they&#8217;re a douchebag.</p>

    <link href="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2012/12/07/ncls2011/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-07T20:17:00+11:00</updated>
    <id>http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/blog/2012/12/07/ncls2011</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/in-spite-of-the-scandals-religious-groups-still-lead-the-way-on-public-good-20121206-2ay69.html">Andrew West published an opinion piece suggesting the church should still be considered a public good despite widely publicised scandals</a>. Trying to find sources for the 2011 NCLS data, however, turns up only statements from Dr Ruth Powell, the director of the National Church Life Survey from her <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/religionandethicsreport/australia27s-national-church-life-survey/4397166">interview with West on Radio National</a>. Looking at the transcript, a few key points come up.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ruth Powell: What we see from the results are that even though the church may be smaller than it was in previous decades, in a sense it’s consolidating. It is stronger. The signs of health are greater than they were a decade ago. We don’t have any results on numerical growth or decline at this stage. There are signs overseas that perhaps plateau has taken place. We don’t have the data in Australia yet.</p></blockquote>

<p>8 days earlier, the <a href="http://www.theherald.com.au/story/1131735/opinion-churches-future-depends-on-their-followers/">Herald Sun published Powell&#8217;s opinion piece</a> specifying that the proportion of believers going to church once a month is &#8220;around 15%&#8221;, whereas <a href="http://www.ncls.org.au/default.aspx?docid=2278">NCLS data</a> from 1998 found that 20% of the population claimed to attend religious services at least monthly or more often and in 2002 this figure had dropped to 18.6% of the population. The continuation of the decline from 2002 should also suggest that when the figure is released, it is likely that weekly attendence will have also dropped below the <a href="http://www.ncls.org.au/default.aspx?docid=2250">7.5% of Australians in 2001</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ruth Powell: Six out of ten people who are in church are women. Now that’s not a new trend. Women are generally more religious than men. That’s something that sociologists have found in pretty well every country and every religion&#8230; And there are some signs that working women are less likely to go to church than men&#8230;</p>

<p>Church is a space that is often very relational. And women tend to be strong in terms of building and nurturing relationships with others. And I think that the space for exploring those issues…church communities, faith communities, facilitate that sort of relationship&#8230;</p>

<p>We have many studies happening in terms of attitudes to women. But there are those who are embracing the role of women in leadership and those who have a different perspective. But what we see is, women are the bedrock of a lot of churches. They are the ones who are filling voluntary roles, not only in the churches but also in terms of the wider communities.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many Christians have opinions on the cause of the observed gender gap. Christian Piatt suggests that it is normal and natural for <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/why-women-are-the-key-to-the-churchs-future/">women to be caregivers and therefore are better at establishing community</a>. But this glosses over the real issues, and the major implications in church life. With over 60% of the church being women, a third less men are there. 25% of married Christian women <a href="http://churchformen.com/men-and-church/info-for-pastors/">go to churches their husbands refuse to attend</a>.</p>

<p>This leaves roughly 8% are single women who don&#8217;t have single men in their church to consider dating, a position that can be emotionally draining.
David Murrow, author of Why Men Hate Church tells the story of Caroline, &#8220;a twenty-nine-year-old single woman who won’t date non-Christian men. “But I’m beginning to rethink that&#8230; There are no single guys my age.&#8221; Many other Christian singles have given up on the idea that they could meet a Christian man at church, worried that they <a href="http://oursinglepurpose.com/2012/10/10/be-still/">&#8220;would miss out on “the man” if [they] chose the wrong gym&#8221;</a>. Responding to a blog post on singleness, churchgoing Sydney Anglican women spoke of dejection at being <a href="http://sydneyanglicans.net/life/daytoday/single_christian_female_30">isolated and ignored for their singleness</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>I often feel like the freak no one wants to talk to at church…”</p>

<p>“[singles] feel invisible or unwanted because they are in the minority.”</p>

<p>“I don&#8217;t want to be left standing all by myself after church or have people walk away from me when I try and start a conversation with them.”</p>

<p>“It is so painfully lonely not fitting in and feeling socially worthless, particularly when you hear about all the social gatherings that go on, none of which you ever receive an invitation to. It is awful.”</p>

<p>“It is really hard to continue going to church when every week you know you will be left out after the meeting. It is painful watching friends greet each other and give out invites and be all happy and together.”</p>

<p>“I am looking for a little bit of love from my Christian community, but instead I feel like a leper… I never get invited anywhere.”</p>

<p>“People think that you must be busy Friday and Saturday nights, and the reality is, that you’re sitting at home in front of the TV…”</p>

<p>“I have not met any single person in their 30s who is not really hurting… Get to your mid 30s, when all your friends are married, the reality is that while your married friends&#8217; social network is rapidly expanding, the single persons&#8217; network is rapidly diminishing.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Murrow suggests that the church drives &#8216;manly&#8217; men away with its feminised culture. He writes <a href="http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/ChurchAndMinistry/menhatingchurch.aspx">&#8220;Today’s churchgoing man is humble, tidy, dutiful, and above all, nice&#8221;</a>, suggesting that men excusing themselves saying that church is boring and irrelevant could be more concerned at the lack of masculinity. Murrow&#8217;s critique is mostly directed at stylistic issues, suggesting that &#8220;The feminine atmosphere in our churches causes women to feel loved and nurtured, but men to feel hesitant and restrained&#8221; and pushing for changes to preaching styles and worship teams.</p>

<p>Dr Rod Rosenbladt goes further than stylistic issues, suggesting that <a href="http://www.newreformationpress.com/blog/nrp-freebies/the-gospel-for-those-broken-by-the-church/">it is the ministers who closely identify with the maternal symbolism of church</a>, making the many men (and women) already angry with what the church has done reject it outright:</p>

<blockquote><p>There is a predictable psychological profile of the clergy, including our closer
relationship with our mothers, but not with our fathers. For most of us pastors, the link
between Jesus and the church (a mother symbol) is so tight, so identical, that to be
angry with mother church is the same as rejecting Jesus! It is not.</p></blockquote>

<p>Paul Coughlin paints a starker picture of churches <a href="http://www.crosswalk.com/blogs/paul-coughlin/pain-and-prejudice-11535858.html">actively driving away men by demonising them as spiritual losers and sexual predators</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Here are some of the messages Christian men have been told, some for decades:</p>

<ul>
<li>If there is a major problem in a couple’s marriage, whether or not it leads to divorce, it is ultimately the husband’s fault.</li>
<li>Women are more moral and spiritual than men.</li>
<li>Women are more sensitive to the Holy Spirit than men.</li>
</ul>


<p>Christian men don’t like the prejudice against them, they complain&#8211;sometimes bitterly&#8211;in private, but they keep going, though something happens to many of them beginning in their late thirties. Church becomes a chore. And a bore. They go out of duty, not because they receive much inspiration there as men, or truly helpful instruction regarding marriage and gender differences. They go because they feel they have to.</p>

<p>If you question this prejudice against men, then ask yourself: Why do men have “Accountability Groups,” at church, yet women have “Fellowship Groups”? Men are treated as if they are one step away from committing felonies. So they require constant monitoring, constant “accountability,” as if they are at risk of jumping a form of spiritual bail.</p>

<p>Bigotry robs people of dignity and value. It frustrates common and healthy human desires, creates dark psychic storm clouds, and unless a man is unusually robust, creates spiritual fissures. Bitterness, anger, and resentment seep into men’s souls</p></blockquote>

<p>Powell goes on to explain the aeging demographic, correllated with an oversupply of women in dying churches.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ruth Powell: The average age of a church attender is 55-years-old. And that is ageing. So those big mainstream denominations have more older people and partly it’s history catching up with them. In the ’60s and ’70s, the baby-boomers—those born after World War II—as we say: they voted with their feet. And they said, church is not engaging me, the institutional church is not making a connection—they left. And the church said, that’s all right, they’ll be back, they’ll have kids and they’ll come back, because that’s what’s always happened in the past—and it had. Your stage of life was the thing that affected. The problem is, that generation didn’t come back, the following generation were less there and then now, the children are less there.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many Chrisitans believe that the Millenial generation will come back into the church if young adults leave during their younger years. But discussion from Barna suggests that this may not be the case, with <a href="http://www.barna.org/teens-next-gen-articles/534-five-myths-about-young-adult-church-dropouts">the Millenial generation delaying committment, marriage and children</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Millennials are getting married roughly six years later than did the Boomers; they are having their first child much later in life; and they are eight times more likely than were the youth of the 1960s to come from homes where their own biological parents were never married&#8230;  If this generation is having children later in life, are church leaders simply content to wait longer? And if Mosaics return, will they do so with extra burdens—emotional, financial, spiritual, and relational—from their years apart from Christian community? More to the point, what if Mosaics turn out to be a generation in which most do not return?</p></blockquote>

<p>Other trends indicate that more children are born out of wedlock. If couples with chrilden are key to the future of the church, will churches be ready to accept those who have had their kids before marriage, if they married at all? Dr Arnie Cole suggests that the church has a bad history in this regard, with many <a href="http://www.gotandemblog.com/mean-christians">mean, bitter Christians proclaiming their self-righteousness and believing it is evangelism</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>when I was a non-believer living with Char before we were married, a Christian brother would come up to me and say bluntly that all fornicators go to hell. This poor guy tried to do all the work of the Holy Spirit for me, the spiritual loser. This mean-spirited approach simply left out the heart of Jesus or the love He has for the lost person.</p>

<p>The funny thing is, Satan tricked him into thinking he had proclaimed God’s Word when, actually, I was so offended that I’d become more resistant than I was before God was “proclaimed” to me.</p></blockquote>

<p>This form of moralising is a far cry from preaching that Jesus wants the rose.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ruth Powell: we can see the ageing starting with the Pentecostals but they are still much younger even than the general Australian population and that’s an interesting story for all the churches to listen to and say, what is attractive to some young people, Australian people, that those Pentecostal churches are offering&#8230;</p>

<p>Whether that’s the music…but it’s things such as language, dress, informality et cetera, that means there are fewer cultural barriers for a society, say, that has become more informal. Now, I still think that there are a lot of young people who have disengaged from not only church, but from religion and spirituality generally. And that’s what we hear from the wider community. And so even though some churches are doing well at connecting, I think the message remains that there are a lot of young people for whom the churches have not yet found a way of communicating their message in an engaging or relevant way.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many have written on the challenge of creating a community that is <a href="rachelheldevans.com/sunday-morning">culturally relevant while also theologically open to questions on non core issues</a>. Rachel Held Evans writes that she is &#8220;tired of being seen as a project and a prayer request because I believe the earth is more than 6,000 years old and that Anne Frank didn’t go to hell&#8221;. In fact, Brian McLaren suggests that conservative churches with a young demographic <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-d-mclaren/why-do-evangelicals-disli_b_517094.html">attract many theological liberals who keep quiet about their beliefs</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many are afraid to admit that they voted for Barack Obama, or believe in evolution, or are concerned about global climate change, or are OK with their friends being gay or priests being married, or use birth control, or wish women could be treated as equals in their church, or don&#8217;t take every word of the Bible as having equal authority and historical accuracy. If they speak up, they will be shunned by their religious authorities &#8211; and zapped by their fellow Christians who have been told to press the punishment button when anyone dares to differ by giving the &#8220;wrong&#8221; answer. So they comply.</p></blockquote>

<p>West goes on to quiz Powell about why people go to church.</p>

<blockquote><p>Andrew West: [Church atendees] go because they believe in God. But for some people it’s actually a lot more complex.</p>

<p>Ruth Powell: No, in fact we know from our…people who are new to church life, that beliefs come later. You start with belonging. You start with relationship. You start going to church because a friend says, hey, this is a place that’s helped me in my life; it’s helped, it’s…you know, they fed me when my…when we were going hungry, they’ve helped my kids, they were there when life was tough for me. You should come and check this place out. It’s a good community to be part of. Newcomers come because someone invited them.</p>

<p>Now when we look at just the broader spread of church attenders, why do they go? It is faith…it’s reasons of practices of faith. They’re going to explore faith, to grow in their faith, to find out about faith. And so you look…that’s what they value; they value those aspects that are the faith practices. They also value belonging. And what they…when we ask them, what do you think this church should be working on in the next 12 months—because in a sense this is a strategic planning tool for churches—and we say, all right, what can you improve on? The top thing is, we want…make this place a place where people feel they belong. Grow our sense of community and belonging because again, it’s the Putnam bonding social capital, you know. It’s in that social glue that I can grow in my faith. This is not a solo thing. I do it better with other people.</p></blockquote>

<p>Evangelicals have always believed that the bible can be shown to be evidentially true, and that faith following from the facts is enough to create feelings among believers.</p>

<p>From the section &#8221;<a href="http://www.campuscrusade.com/Now-That-You-Have-Received-Christ.html">Now That You Have Received Christ</a>&#8221; from the Campus Crusade for Christ&#8217;s 1958 Four Spiritual Laws booklet</p>

<blockquote><p>Do Not Depend on Feelings</p>

<p>The promise of God&#8217;s Word, the Bible - not our feelings - is our authority. The Christian lives by faith (trust) in the trustworthiness of God Himself and His Word. This train diagram illustrates the relationship among fact (God and His Word), faith (our trust in God and His Word), and feeling (the result of our faith and obedience) (John 14:21).</p>

<p><img src="http://Nsewell.github.com/nsewell/images/caboose.gif" title="Caboose of Feelings pulled by Faith" alt="Caboose of Feelings pulled by Faith" /></p>

<p>The train will run with or without a caboose. However, it would be useless to attempt to pull the train by the caboose. In the same way, as Christians we do not depend on feelings or emotions, but we place our faith (trust) in the trustworthiness of God and the promises of His Word.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting to find a Catholic admitting that, for some believers, it seems to be that the train of belief is driven by the caboose, with belief in God and adoption of Christian teaching and morals following a feeling of acceptance and belonging in the community.</p>

<blockquote><p>Andrew West: How many people find it easy to ask others to come to church?</p>

<p>Ruth Powell: Well I think this is the key story for the churches. I think churches…if we sling back in history, you had the village church and mostly Anglican, you know: Church of England. Every village had their church and everybody in the village belonged to the village church. And that was brought out to Australia and you had the parish church and if you were in that parish, and this is how still the Catholics think, if you’re in the parish and you’re Catholic, well you belong to our parish.</p>

<p>Now that’s all breaking down now. And the place of church in Australian society, as in many western societies, is being renegotiated. And I think the church is probably a little bit in the wilderness at the moment and it’s going to take decades—it is taking decades—to find their role and their place. And partly, the churches are needing to discover what it is to be in mission, to be a sent people again, and to actually work out how to speak of the message that they believe they have, to a society that is saying, you are not relevant, you are not useful, I do not trust you. And so inviting becomes to relationship and you need to invite. And churches…people who go to church, if church is to survive, people will need to have to work out how to share in an authentic way what it is that their faith community offers them and why they would encourage others authentically to experience that same…</p></blockquote>
