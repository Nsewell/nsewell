  <div class="entry-content"><p>90% of tech startups fail, but entrepreneurs don&#8217;t like to dwell on it.</p>

<p>Nikki Durkin was a young age, selling t-shirts on ebay in school, and pitching a fashion marketplace to her business studies class. She found girls like her had a wardrobe full of clothes but nothing to wear, so created &#8220;crack for women&#8221; by setting up a greymarket for fast fashion which quickly gained traction with a passionate user base who loved being able to trade the latest outfits. Nikki launched her business in a red ocean space where she might have beaten competitors if not for a series of setbacks from co-founder health issues, being treated as a terrorist by the US consulate and having two co-founders pull out just before closing a funding round.</p>

<p>Nikki has a long post that&#8217;s probably the most <a href="https://medium.com/@nikkidurkin99/my-startup-failed-and-this-is-what-it-feels-like-c5d64b3ae96b">honest and heartfelt</a> accounts from a founder I&#8217;ve read.</p>

<blockquote><p>I didn’t fail then. I couldn’t fail. This was my baby, and if it was going to fail it would be over my dead body&#8230; I told my mum I didn’t trust my gut when it came to this. My gut was telling me to quit. Problem was, my gut had told me that before in my darkest hours and I still pulled through. If I had trusted my gut then I would have quit years ago.</p>

<p>I knew the only way this was going to die was if we were killed. I am not a quitter. I owed it to myself, my team, my investors and the 99dresses community to see this through&#8230;</p>

<p>Once or twice I’d have an investor asking if I knew what an angel was, or if I also modelled because of my height, or some other unintentionally patronizing comment that I doubt any guy would be subjected to. I learned to take it all in my high-heeled stride.</p></blockquote>

<p>I can&#8217;t do justice to the post and the incredible frustration of dealing with angels and VCs that don&#8217;t close in time to save the business.</p>

<p>Nikki&#8217;s gone home from NYC to Callala Bay, with a population of 2,000. Everyone in the tech sector should want to back our entrepreneurs who want to make Australia more than just sells pepole rocks we dig out of the Pilbara, but we have to be honest about what the startup meat grinder can actually be like.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve written before about how [eye tracking can predict political preferences[(/blog/2014/04/05/eye-tracking). People who put more effort into actively avoiding disgusting images are more likely to be politically conservative:</p>

<p>I absolutely loved reading Jonathan Haidt&#8217;s <em><a href="http://righteousmind.com/">The Righteous Mind - why good pepole are divided by religion and politics</a></em>, which makes a strong argument that our genetics influence our political leanings. David Pizarro and Jonathan Haidt have built upon earlier work on the disgust reflex to explore how the reflex to spit out impure food is triggered when we think of disgusting sex practices, or &#8220;unclean&#8221; people. Haidt ran a study where he asked Americans how they would feel if an old woman needed a rag to clean a toilet, and she <a href="http://www.commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Haidt-Moral-Dumfounding-When-Intuition-Finds-No-Reason.pdf">ripped up an old American flag she didn&#8217;t want</a>. Conservatives were furious at the sacrilige of tearing up a flag in the privacy of her own house, while liberals argued that the community should tolerate a woman choosing how to use her own flag inside her own house. Another study asked how people would feel about a <a href="http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/haidt.hersh.2001.sexual-morality.pub021.pdf">34 year old woman masturbating while cuddling her favourite teddy bear</a>. People who felt disgusted often put forward religious arguments about the design of the body. Pizarro, in a follow up, found that people were more likely to be judgemental of the unusual sex practice when standing next to a reminder to wash their hands:</p>

<p>Critically, Pizarro explains how Nazi propaganda taught German children to hate Jews because they were <a href="http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/thumb.htm">reviled as filthy people</a>, with books teaching &#8220;Just look at these guys! The louse-infested beards! The filthy, protruding ears, those stained, fatty clothes&#8230; Jews often have an unpleasent sweetish odor. If you have a good nose, you can smell the Jews.&#8221; Disgust continues to be one of a <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/08/anti_gay_bigotry_online_analyzing_homophobic_comments_can_disarm_the_hate_.html">range of tactics</a> put forward by those willing to limit the rights of a social group, or <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/north-carolina-pastor-calls-death-gays-lesbians-trapping-electric-fence-article-1.1082160">ostracise them completely</a>.</p>

<p>One of the clearest indicators that the Christian notion of the <em>Witness of the Holy Spirit</em> doesn&#8217;t exist is that it gets confused with personal bigotry. One Chrisitan minister in Sydney has married a former sex worker, but many Chrisitans, while they praise this action as emblematic of forgiveness and grace central to the religion, admit that the would never be able to accept a woman with an extensive past sexual history.</p>

<p>Recently Michael Sam was the first openly gay player drafted to the United States National Football League. Recently a Dallas TV panellist walked off the set when the show broadcast a kiss between Sam and his boyfriend in celebration of the draft, despite earlier showcasing <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/05/16/anti-gay-texas-talk-show-host-gets-her-heart-pounded-by-half-naked-male-strippers/">topless male strippers in the program</a>. Now the editor of <em>Wing Nut Daily</em> has said that pepole who feel a disgust reaction at seeing a homosexual kiss are experiencing &#8221;<a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/david-kupelian-says-revulsion-yucky-michael-sam-kiss-something-god">something from God</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Richard Beck has been <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com.au/2013/02/the-psychology-of-christian-purity.html">writing on this for years</a>, and the No Shame Movement has started to <a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/god/church/how-not-talk-about-purity">pick up traction within mainstream evangelicalism</a>. With ongoing <a href="http://prospect.org/article/next-christian-sex-abuse-scandal">sex abuse scandals</a> all over the evangelical world, evangelical leaders can no longer drag their heels on changes that everyone knows need to happen.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Macleans has great articles. American politics, like in many other OECD countries, as politicians <a href="http://www.macleans.ca/politics/america-dumbs-down/">communicate in simple soundbites while giving campaign funders and corporate lobbyists most of the power</a></p>

<blockquote><p>The trends are not encouraging. In 1978, 42 per cent of Americans reported that they had read 11 or more books in the past year. In 2014, just 28 per cent can say the same, while 23 per cent proudly admit to not having read even one, up from eight per cent in 1978. Newspaper and magazine circulation continues to decline sharply, as does viewership for cable news. The three big network supper-hour shows drew a combined average audience of 22.6 million in 2013, down from 52 million in 1980. While 82 per cent of Americans now say they seek out news digitally, the quality of the information they’re getting is suspect. Among current affairs websites, Buzzfeed logs almost as many monthly hits as the Washington Post&#8230;</p>

<p>By 2008, journalist Susan Jacoby was warning that the denseness—“a virulent mixture of anti-rationalism and low expectations”—was more of a permanent state. In her book, The Age of American Unreason, she posited that it trickled down from the top, fuelled by faux-populist politicians striving to make themselves sound approachable rather than smart. Their creeping tendency to refer to everyone—voters, experts, government officials—as “folks” is “symptomatic of a debasement of public speech inseparable from a more general erosion of American cultural standards,” she wrote</p>

<p>An aversion to complexity—at least when communicating with the public—can also be seen in the types of answers politicians now provide the media. The average length of a sound bite by a presidential candidate in 1968 was 42.3 seconds. Two decades later, it was 9.8 seconds. Today, it’s just a touch over seven seconds and well on its way to being supplanted by 140-character Twitter bursts.</p>

<p>Little wonder then that distrust—of leaders, institutions, experts, and those who report on them—is rampant. A YouGov poll conducted last December found that three-quarters of Americans agreed that science is a force for good in the world. Yet when asked if they truly believe what scientists tell them, only 36 per cent of respondents said yes. Just 12 per cent expressed strong confidence in the press to accurately report scientific findings. (Although according to a 2012 paper by Gordon Gauchat, a University of North Carolina sociologist, the erosion of trust in science over the past 40 years has been almost exclusively confined to two groups: conservatives and regular churchgoers. Counterintuitively, it is the most highly educated among them—with post-secondary education—who harbour the strongest doubts.)</p>

<p>The term “elitist” has become one of the most used, and feared, insults in American life. Even in the country’s halls of higher learning, there is now an ingrained bias that favours the accessible over the exacting.</p>

<p>The digital revolution, which has brought boundless access to information and entertainment choices, has somehow only enhanced the lowest common denominators—LOL cat videos and the Kardashians. Instead of educating themselves via the Internet, most people simply use it to validate what they already suspect, wish or believe to be true. It creates an online environment where Jenny McCarthy, a former Playboy model with a high school education, can become a worldwide leader of the anti-vaccination movement, naysaying the advice of medical professionals.</p>

<p>Most perplexing, however, is where the stupid is flowing from. As conservative pundit David Frum recently noted, where it was once the least informed who were most vulnerable to inaccuracies, it now seems to be the exact opposite. “More sophisticated news consumers turn out to use this sophistication to do a better job of filtering out what they don’t want to hear,” he blogged.</p></blockquote>

<p>Emma Teitel notes that digital media is making the problem worse, with the public experiencing information overload as society rapidly changes, as outlined in Alvin Toffler&#8217;s <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Shock">Future Shock</a></strong>. She <a href="http://www.macleans.ca/culture/going-viral-at-the-expense-of-our-privacy/">writes</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>60 per cent of Canadians would not change their Internet or phone behaviour if they suspected the government was spying on them. We are clearly fascinated by the secretly recorded outbursts of the morally bankrupt and grotesque—à la Rob Ford and Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling—but when it comes to the erosion of privacy among normal people at the hands of government and big corporations, we’re more or less ambivalent. It appears we’d rather share spoken-word poems on Facebook about the vacuous nature of social media than make a stink about the possibility that our government and the telecom companies that pander to it are taking advantage of us while we do.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Google&#8217;s acquisition of Motorola is likely to pay off, with glowing reviews of their new $130 smartphone putting all of their competitors on notice. Last year Nokia announced a <a href="http://www.cnet.com/products/nokia-lumia-520/">$100 Lumia 520 smartphone</a> running Windows phone, and Google and Microsoft are going to continue to try to undercut each other to vie for dominance of the developing market. IDC data indicate that in 2013, the average worldwide <a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24461213">price of a smartphone was $337</a>, down from $387 in 2012. With Google using Motorola to dramatically undercut the market prices are likely to fall faster than anticipated, in a move that will be a major win for consumers in developing markets. IDC predicted that the average worldwide smartphone price would fall to $265 by 2017, while the North American average of $531 would rise to $567, but with Google and Microsoft pushing entry level phones I predict it will go down significantly.</p>

<p>Recently, it&#8217;s hit the news that parents in an Idaho school district successfully campaigned to remove Sherman Alexie&#8217;s acclaimed Young Adult novel, The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian. The multi award winning book was pulled from the shelves after parents objected to its coarse language, references to masturbation, and political criticism of Christian conservatives. Parents called <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140428/11320827052/censorious-parent-calls-cops-teen-giving-away-books-local-park.shtml">the cops on a student at the high school</a> giving out free copies of the book to peers after the school pulled the book.</p>

<p>The American Library Association has pointed out how farcical censorship is when the #1 most banned book, <strong>Captain Underpants</strong>, <a href="http://ncac.org/censorship-article/state-of-censorship-unabridged-contributions-from-our-participants/">is read by parents to children</a>. The potty humour in the book is designed to make young children giggle and parents roll their eyes. Challenges to the book highlight the absurdity of one group of parents deciding on behalf of every other family in a library district what morals the children are to be raised with.</p>

<p>The National Coalition Against Censorship highlights in their Kids Rights to Read Project that the majority of the most influential books of all time were at one time censored:</p>

<p><img src="/images/ncac-banned.png" title="&#34;70% of 'Books that shaped America' have been banned&#34;" alt="&#34;70% of 'Books that shaped America' have been banned&#34;"></p>

<p>The actions of the student in distributing the book, which they love, to younger students in year 10 shows that an intergeneration values disconnect is not going to be solved with parental censorship of the media or libraries, and ultimately highlight why teenagers are justified in abandoning the values of their parents.</p>

<p>Attempts at book censorship are going to become increasingly farcical when technology allows individual consumers to buy books that aren&#8217;t stocked in their local library or their local state. <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/wp/online/87-of-american-adults-now-access-the-internet-41043/">97% of 18-29</a> year olds use the internet.</p>

<p>2014 figures show that tablet ownership in the US is up to <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/wp/online/us-tablet-ownership-update-january-2014-39508/">44% of the adult population</a>, and <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media//Files/Reports/2014/PIP_E-reading_011614.pdf">50% of adults have either a tablet or an e-reader</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/tablet-ereader.png" title="&#34;50% of adults in the United States how have either a tablet or an e-reader&#34;" alt="&#34;50% of adults in the United States how have either a tablet or an e-reader&#34;"></p>

<p>Nielsen has slightly higher estimates of Smartphone ownership among teens, estimating that 70 percent of teens aged 13-17 <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/newswire/2013/ring-the-bells-more-smartphones-in-students-hands-ahead-of-back.html">own smartphones</a>, while 79% of young adults aged 18-24 do.</p>

<p>Figures from September 2013 show that <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media//Files/Reports/2013/PIP_Tablets%20and%20e-readers%20update_101813.pdf">46% of 16-17 year olds have tablets</a>, while 24% have e-book readers. 91% of them have cell phones, while 68% have smartphones.</p>

<p><img src="/images/pew-smartphone-household.png" title="Pew Household income vs Smartphone ownership rates" ></p>

<p>Smartphones are owned by only 41% of people in with a household income under $30,000 US, rising to 84% of those with household incomes over $150,000. Hopefully with entry level smartphones offering decent performance at US $100, cellphone customers in low income households will move to smartphones in a few years.</p>

<p>One of the other major areas where censorship has played out is in sex education, where conservative states have passed laws banning factual sex education and enforcing ineffectual abstinence-only curricula. With smartphone access to apps by <a href="https://healthcenter.uoregon.edu/Home/SexPositive.aspx">Oregon university</a> and other providers these laws will quickly become redundant, as teens seek out factual, unbiased information online.</p>

<p>Any ideology, political or religious, that requires the censorship of every family within a school district is not going to survive the age of the internet.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In June 2011 <a href="http://chipberlet.blogspot.com.au/">Chip Berlet</a> saw Occupy Wall Street facing a takeover by parasitic sectarian groups, and republished his 1999 essay on <a href="http://chipberlet.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/abstaining-from-bad-sects.html">cadre ultra-leftist sects</a>. The entire essay is worth a read, here are some highlights:</p>

<blockquote><p>To describe cadre-based sectarian ultra-leftists as tedious and disruptive is a charitable understatement</p></blockquote>

<p>Noting the similarity of leftist political division to religious sectarianism:</p>

<blockquote><p>When a sect tries to enforce these views on everyone, member and non-member alike, the sect [embraces] an inappropriate demand for a mass group to accept uncritically the ideological precepts of a specific group or individual.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the requirement to toe the party line, ostensibly reached though consultation</p>

<blockquote><p>Once a specific position is arrived at, cadre are expected to support the decision, and refrain from any disagreement with or criticisms of the &#8220;line&#8221; with persons or groups outside of the cadre organization. When people talk about &#8220;The Party Line,&#8221; they mean the line the cadre group members are bound to uphold in public.</p>

<p>Ultra-leftism is an egocentric form of mythopoetic martyrdom whereby practitioners anoint themselves as the beleaguered guardians of the one true political line. They read long impenetrable manifestos at public meetings. They show up at mass demonstrations with helmets and hockey sticks for a game of self-fulfilling prophecy that often results in violence as they hurl themselves at police. They inevitably urge a course of action that is hopelessly out of touch with reality. Even Lenin called this an &#8220;infantile disorder.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Berlet quotes Andrew Freenberg on how leftist groups prioritise an identity of revolution over effective campaigning:</p>

<blockquote><p>Sectarianism in the movement was based on a sense of moral superiority that was effective in motivating an in-group but incompatible with its expansion among those sympathetic to its program. Moral heroism mobilized the troops, but it was accompanied by a characteristic romantic elitism rooted in a sense of differentness, of sacrifice and oppression&#8230; Many new left groups preferred to substitute individual morality for politics and became obsessively concerned with establishing the revolutionary personal identity of their members at the expense of effective action on the real world.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some of the social psychologists who&#8217;ve studied inter-group conflict and how it applies to politics recommend that people try to reach <a href="http://www.civilpolitics.org/content/tom-edsalls-guide-what-each-side-gets-right/">across party lines to find comonality on key issues</a>, and recognise what their opponents get right. If an asteroid were heading towards earth and was going to destroy the planet, people would instinctively reach across party lines to solve the problem as quickly as possible, rather than trying to boost their poll numbers with divisive rhetoric over the failings of the other side. Jonathan Haidt&#8217;s research suggests that Progressives have more work to do than Conservatives in trying to understand the perspective of voters they disagree with.</p>

<p>Andrew Sullivan is one of few critics who is willing to stand up and <a href="http://dish.andrewsullivan.com/2014/04/28/the-pernicious-poison-of-palin-ctd/">criticise her with the full force she deserves</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Now look how far we have come from the original notion – pioneered by Charles Krauthammer and popularized by “24″ – that torture should only be used in the hypothetical ticking time-bomb case. That argument – only ever hypothetical – nonetheless assumes that torture is evil and should only be used in extremis to prevent imminent catastrophe. Palin, in contrast, like her party, has long since blown past such niceties. She believes that torture should be the first resort – a sign of how America treats its foes, a badge of honor.</p>

<p>What can one say but that this is a bona fide fascistic sentiment. It revels in violence against individuals tied down by their hands and feet and strapped to a terrifying board in order to be suffocated hundreds of times to near-death&#8230; Even totalitarian regimes have publicly denied their torture. Their reticence and lies are some small concession of vice to the appearance of virtue. Not Palin – who wants to celebrate brutal torture as the American way.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sullivan notes that in <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2009/04/29/the-religious-dimensions-of-the-torture-debate/">recent polling</a> on the issue, 62% of White evangelical Christians support torture, while only 40% of religiously unaffiliated Americans do. Support for torture is highest among those who attend church weekly. Torture has become a <em>Christian</em> value in America:</p>

<p><img src="/images/pew-torture.png" width="2009" title="Pew polling on torture against suspected terrorists" ></p>

<blockquote><p>It seems to me, moreover, that torture is a far graver evil, even for orthodox theologians, than non-procreative or non-marital sex. And yet today’s Christianists are obsessed about the latter and not just indifferent to the former, but actually in favor of it. It’s this twisted set of priorities, this exquisitely misplaced set of fears, and this utter ignorance of even basic Christian teaching that reveals all that’s so terribly wrong with American Christianity. It has become its own nemesis.</p></blockquote>

<p>People often try to put thoughts of death and suffering out of their minds, as they cause anguish and consternation. Positive messages are more likely to be talked about among families and peer-groups.</p>

<p>The voluntary euthanasia campaign has had <a href="http://www.hootville.com/marketingeuthanasia">verry little success</a> in getting their message across.</p>

<blockquote><p>Here’s a list of some groups / issues currently out-performing [voluntary euthanasia]:</p>

<ul>
<li>live cattle;</li>
<li>puppies born in puppy farms;</li>
<li>asylum seekers;</li>
<li>transgendered people;</li>
<li>homosexuals;</li>
<li>the disabled;</li>
<li>victims of domestic violence;</li>
<li>the corral in the barrier reef;</li>
<li>farmers affected by fracking;</li>
<li>victims of sexual abuse at the hands of clergy.</li>
</ul>


<p>These groups are a laundry list of disenfranchised, under-resourced, abused, neglected and unorganised – yet each of them outperform [voluntary euthanasia] week-in, week-out in the battle for media space, barbeque discussions and political response.</p></blockquote>

<p>The &#8216;pro-choice&#8217; movement that advocates for a woman&#8217;s right to choose abortion (or not) is careful to state that they are not &#8216;pro-abortion&#8217;. They don&#8217;t prescribe the circumstances under which they believe a woman should seek an abortion, they leave the choice to the individual. The label &#8216;Dying with Dignity&#8217; may not be a good name for the voluntary euthanasia movement, and the group &#8217;<a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2013/198/4/doctors-support-law-reform-voluntary-euthanasia">Doctors for Voluntary Euthanasia Choice</a>&#8217;, are approaching a better label.</p>

<p>Death and suffering are taboo because the thought of them cuases distress, so the voluntary euthanasia movement needs to find positive ways to communicate their message. Additionally, the voluntary euthanasia movement has focussed on ultra-leftist audiences to the detriment of broad community outreach.</p>

<p>In 2010 a study of Australian attitudes to abortion, <a href="https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2010/193/1/australian-attitudes-early-and-late-abortion">published in the MJA</a> found that contextual details about specific scenarios made people more permissive in their approach to laws:</p>

<blockquote><p>The sensitivity of Australians’ views on abortion to contextual details may have implications for other debates about ethics. The more permissive attitude elicited when context was provided in our study may, for example, carry over to debates about euthanasia, the use of medicine or technology for human enhancement, organ donation, and embryonic stem cell research. It is an open question whether policy formation should be informed by views about abstract propositions or about cases containing contextual details.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The New York Times has a good discussion of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/books/review/would-you-kill-the-fat-man-and-the-trolley-problem.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;">Trolley Problem</a></p>

<blockquote><p>You are walking near a trolley-car track when you notice five people tied to it in a row. The next instant, you see a trolley hurtling toward them, out of control. A signal lever is within your reach; if you pull it, you can divert the runaway trolley down a side track, saving the five — but killing another person, who is tied to that spur. What do you do? Most people say they would pull the lever: Better that one person should die instead of five.</p>

<p>Now, a different scenario. You are on a footbridge overlooking the track, where five people are tied down and the trolley is rushing toward them. There is no spur this time, but near you on the bridge is a chubby man. If you heave him over the side, he will fall on the track and his bulk will stop the trolley. He will die in the process. What do you do? (We presume your own body is too svelte to stop the trolley, should you be considering noble self-sacrifice.)</p></blockquote>

<p>I loved Jonathan Haidt&#8217;s reconciliation of moral psychology with the old philosophical question, and this is an area where a lot of people are turning to hard science to understand ethical reasoning.</p>

<p>Fun facts:</p>

<blockquote><p>In 1944, new German V-1 rockets started pounding the southern suburbs of London, though they were clearly aimed at more central areas. The British not only let the Germans think the rockets were on target, but used double agents to feed them information suggesting they should adjust their aim even farther south. The government deliberately placed southern suburbanites in danger, but one scientific adviser, whose own family lived in South London, estimated that some 10,000 lives were saved as a result. A still more momentous decision occurred the following year when America dropped atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on the argument that a quick end to the war would save lives — and by macabre coincidence, the Nagasaki bomb was nicknamed Fat Man. Similar calculations are being made right now. One has only to think of collateral damage in military strikes, or of the justifications offered for torturing terrorism suspects. At their best, such reasonings are valid; at their worst, they are a writhing nest of weasels.</p></blockquote>

<p>If it is considered ethical to select which civilians die in enemy bombings, is it ethical to subject your own soldiers to <a href="http://www.nyam.org/news/press-releases/2008/3096.html">chemical weapons</a> during tests?</p>

<blockquote><p>In the early 1940s, medical scientists funded by the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service conducted painful mustard gas experiments on at least 60,000 American soldiers. The Allies, including the governments of Canada, Britain, Australia, and the United States, conducted these experiments on their own soldiers in order to identify the impact of chemical weapons on the health of soldiers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many people see this as one of the cases of the long history of morally dubious, and often downright criminal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_experimentation_in_the_United_States">human experiments carried out without informed consent</a>. Nazi scientists during the Nuremberg trials cited American human experiments carried out without the knowledge of prison inmates.</p>

<p>In some areas it&#8217;s hard to tell whether the history of abuses of human experimentation is worse in the US or in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_human_experimentation">Nazi Germany</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_human_experimentation">Japan</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_laboratory_of_the_Soviet_secret_services">Russia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_22">North Korea</a>.</p>

<p>Many international critics successfully argue against human rights abuses in other countries, but freqently do so while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_you_are_lynching_Negroes">covering up their own</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Barney Zwartz, retired religion columnist for the Age, has a good piece on the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-04-14/zwartz-sparking-the-moral-imagination-of-the-masses/5388414">messaging of refugee advocates</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The message was that [refugee advocates] were the compassionate ones, the moral ones, the real Australians. The implication, well-understood and resented by opponents, is that those who disagree with the protesters are selfish, uncaring and/or racist and/or morally torpid&#8230;</p>

<p>Stigmatising half the population is no way to persuade people; it is no way to change refugee policy. Nor do I believe it is accurate. How such a large proportion of Australians came to see people fleeing persecution as illegals, queue jumpers, economic migrants, and a threat to our national economy and security is too big a subject to tackle here, but it is the successful result of malign policy and media slanting.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is quite a complex issue indeed. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_Foundations_Theory">Moral Foundations Theory</a> shows that most political arguments touch on six core values:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Care</strong>/<strong>harm</strong> for others, protecting them from harm.<br/>
<strong>Fairness</strong>/<strong>cheating</strong>, Justice, treating others in proportion to their actions
<strong>Liberty</strong>/<strong>oppression</strong>, characterizes judgments in terms of whether subjects are tyrannized.<br/>
<strong>Loyalty</strong>/<strong>betrayal</strong> to your group, family, nation.
<strong>Authority</strong>/<strong>subversion</strong> for tradition and legitimate authority.
<strong>Sanctity</strong>/<strong>degradation</strong>, avoiding disgusting things, foods, actions.</p></blockquote>

<p>Jonathan Haidt, the theory&#8217;s author has found that people have strange ideas about the notion of Sanctity. When asked if it&#8217;s OK for an old lady to tear up an unwanted national flag to wipe down her toilet bowl, many people are disgusted and outraged, but struggle to say why it&#8217;s wrong to use her own property in the privacy of her own home in the way she wishes. The majority of people believe that the flag is a sacred symbol, and indeed the Union Jack is made up of three crucifixes. Many Australians feel a sense of social identity from their belonging to the nation state, and John Howard would not have mandated that every public school must have a national flag in 2004 if it didn&#8217;t make for powerful propaganda. When Amanda Bishop and Phil Lloyd satirised the prime minister having sex wrapped in an Australian flag liberals were amused while conservatives <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-09-20/mps-angered-over-gillard-satire-sex-scene/2908158">were out for blood</a></p>

<div class="figure"><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-09-20/mps-angered-over-gillard-satire-sex-scene/2908158"><img src="/images/kerr-flag.png" link="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-09-20/mps-angered-over-gillard-satire-sex-scene/2908158" title="Miranda Kerr's bum received a much warmer reception from conservatives than Amanda Bishop's" ><p>Miranda Kerr&#8217;s bum received a much warmer reception from conservatives than Amanda Bishop&#8217;s</span></a></div>


<p>Many racists express a concern that the country is being &#8220;polluted&#8221; by migrants and their cultural values and religious beleifs. But the vast majority of people do <a href="http://www.themonthly.com.au/blog/richard-cooke/2013/07/25/1374721635/bogans-and-boat-people-pt1">not hold racist sentiments towards immigrants</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>More than 60% of us said we wanted immigration to increase or stay the same. In Germany that figure was 22%&#8230; For a bunch of racists, we are unusually tolerant.</p>

<p>In 2009 Australia had the highest level of immigration per capita in the OECD, eclipsing influxes that have caused tabloid pandemonium elsewhere. A quarter of us were born overseas, almost half have at least one overseas born parent. Interracial marriage, often identified by demographers as a truer indicator of racism than expressed attitudes, is the norm here. A majority of third generation non-English speaking immigrants intermarry, most to Anglo-Celtic Australians. Our treatment of boat people isn&#8217;t just different to how other countries treat refugees. It&#8217;s different to how Australians themselves treat immigrants of every other kind.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the real issues in modern Australia, however, is that while inner city white collar voters enjoy the benefits of globalisation, outer suburban blue collar workers feel deeply concerned about their jobs going offshore. It&#8217;s easier to sell a carbon tax to inner city architects and engineers that design solar panels than to outer suburbs steelworkers and bricklayers that see solar panels manufactured in China and shipped in. Similarly the divide over refugees may not be as much about racism as about class inequality and <a href="http://www.themonthly.com.au/blog/richard-cooke/2013/07/30/1375142271/bogans-and-boat-people-pt-2">job security concerns</a>.</p>

<p>So the Moral Foundation of Sanctity can explain racist opposition to immigration, but anyone that doesn&#8217;t want the country &#8220;polluted&#8221; by refugees would feel the same way about migrants. With the opposition to refugees greater than to migrants, there are other issues at play. Security is frequently portrayed as a major issue, and the claim that Australia&#8217;s borders and soveringnty must be &#8220;protected&#8221; is an effective argument about how people don&#8217;t want their respect for authority to be subverted by people smugglers.</p>

<p>The fact that Howard used military vessels to intercept the Tampa in the same way that customs vessels would target drug smugglers powerfully shaped Australian perceptions of the &#8220;security risk&#8221; of asylum seekers. After the September 11th attacks and 2002 Bali Bombings it became harder for liberals to criticise the use of the Australian military to repel the Tampa. Explaining that Hazara muslims are persecuted by Al-Queda, and that Iranians are mostly secularists repressed by a theocratic government has become harder ever since. The claim that asylum seekers are &#8220;illegals,&#8221; while a blatant lie that has been debunked endlessly, continues to be a powerful tool to elicit the feeling that asylum seekers and people smugglers are subverting Australia&#8217;s rules.</p>

<p>Haidt&#8217;s analysis shows that Sanctity, Authority and Loyalty are moral foundations that social conservatives prioritise, while Compassion, Fairness and Liberty are principles that liberals prioritise. Libertarian care deeply about limiting the size of government because they prioritise freedom from opression above all other moral foundations. Strongly progressive voters base their moral intuitions on compassion far more than any other moral foundation. Critically, social conservatives do not lack compassion, they just base their moral intuitions on compassion in equal proportion to other foundations.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been well established that compassion is the <a href="http://www.crikey.com.au/2013/07/29/let-them-all-come-is-stop-the-boats-for-unthinking-progressives/">only moral foundation</a> being advocated by some progressives. Unfortunately, progressive voices articulate a desire for compassion but don&#8217;t don&#8217;t seem to speak out effectively on how the Australian notion of fairness and egalitarianism is effectively manipulated.</p>

<p>Australia is one of the only countries that links our humanitarian refugee intake to the number of irregular arrivals. The notion that refugees should join a &#8220;queue&#8221; is a powerful appeal to Australia&#8217;s sense of fairness that doesn&#8217;t have simple three word slogan answers. In reality, the UNHCR had 7.1 million refugees in 2011 while <a href="http://theconversation.com/what-role-does-australia-play-in-accepting-the-worlds-refugees-8328">only 79,800 were resettled</a>, meaning that the UNHCR &#8220;queue&#8221; may not clear for any one refugee in their lifetime.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s so much more to write on when it comes to refugees, but the progressive narrative needs to move away from overrepresenting racism in the Australian community. Malcom Fraser prevented Vietnamese from making risky voyages to Australia by boat by setting up a processing centre in Indonesia that quickly processed asylum seekers and put genuine refugees on a plane to the mainland. With conflicts like <a href="http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php">Syria</a>, global refugee numbers are not going down, so the issue is going to need more than three word slogans focussed on the current electoral cycle. That will mean having regional resettlement agreements, which can&#8217;t effectively be negotiated without bipartisanship, which can&#8217;t be achieved without swinging voters on side, which can&#8217;t be achieved unless progressive rhetoric changes to inform, rather than castigate political moderates that currently buy into media misrepresentation of the issue.</p>
