  <div class="entry-content"><p>As Voltaire once said “The secret of being a bore is to tell everything,” and the secret to a good story is to get the listener to care about the exposition before you reveal the conclusion. Many of the videos that go viral online are professionally produced pieces that fool the viewers into sharing the video with friends without realising that it&#8217;s an ad. Recently millions of people shared an artsy black and white video where actors pretended to kiss people for the first time, which was really an ad for a boring clothing company.</p>

<p>Last year Saatchi came up with this piece of slo-mo genius:</p>

<p>Ads that go viral commonly focus on universal human truths that work in any language, on any continent. Many of the popular &#8220;best of web&#8221; videos focus on stunning nature scenes, slo-mo extreme sports and people with weird dance moves.</p>

<p>The parodies of the first kiss video are many and varied, this one with dogs is one of the stranger ones:</p>

<p>Vice created a more realistically awkward video by getting <a href="http://www.vice.com/shorties/we-got-twenty-british-strangers-who-arent-models-to-kiss-each-other">20 strangers who aren&#8217;t models to kiss each other</a>. As Vice notes, a growing number of websites are getting better at <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/the-internet-is-a-giant-lie-factory">tweaking algorithms to pump traffic-magnet content</a> like “Half Way Through These Photos, I Could Barely Handle It. But I’m Glad I Made It to the End… Amazing.” As each new meme website tries to game social algorithms by running other people&#8217;s content under misleading headlines, more and more stories are just beat-ups created for the online outrage factory. One of the most egregious examples of race baiting is the bogus story that Chinese people are grinding up babies into soup to increase their sexual potency. In the race to reach the lowest common denominator, no barrier is too low for a quick buck.</p>

<p>Vice notes that there was a time when <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/why-are-so-many-social-media-managers-dipshits">ad agencies veered on the side of overestimating the intelligence of their customer base</a>, which was before the days of social media marketing managers. Just see <a href="https://www.facebook.com/corporatebollocks">Corporate Brand(R)</a> on Facebook for <strong><em>fantastic</em></strong> ideas about user engagement. For every retweet that the douchebags get, they&#8217;ll even donate up to the fixed amount that they already decided to donate.</p>

<p>Sometimes people make <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/05/anatomy-of-a-fake-quotation/238257/">honest mistakes by repeating accidental misquotes</a>, and indeed one of the most famous Voltaire quotes <a href="http://listverse.com/2008/05/15/top-10-famous-historic-misquotes/">wasn&#8217;t his</a>. Others are trying to make money using the internet to peddle bunk that&#8217;s been around for centuries:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The New York Times has some interesting coverage of recent developments in Ed-Tech. One of the big ones is that the US&#8217;s SAT system is going to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/education/major-changes-in-sat-announced-by-college-board.html?_r=0">partner with Khan Academy</a> to deliver a classroom-focussed college admissions system, and provide preparation to everyone, rather than just the rich that can afford test prep classes. Free preparation for one of the most important US college admissions tests is a <a href="http://khanacademy.com/sat">major coup for the organisation</a> that Bill Gates and others have backed to improve the learning quality of students around the world.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/03/education/new-all-digital-curriculums-hope-to-ride-high-tech-push-in-schoolrooms.html?rref=education">New All-Digital Curriculums Hope to Ride High-Tech Push in Schoolrooms</a></p>

<blockquote><p>English language curriculums built entirely on a digital platform — replacing written textbooks, worksheets or printed study guides — are about to enter the market from several companies, with promises that they will change the nature of classroom learning across the country.</p>

<p>The Obama administration has pledged to provide high-speed Internet connections to 15,000 schools over the next two years, districts are purchasing tablets and laptops for students, and on Friday, President Obama announced $400 million in corporate commitments from the software companies Adobe and Prezi, which will donate software to teachers. Meanwhile, other companies are rushing in.</p>

<p>On Monday at an education conference in Austin, Tex., Joel Klein, the former chancellor of New York City public schools and the current chief executive of Amplify, the education unit of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, will introduce a digital English language arts curriculum for middle school.</p>

<p>Mr. Klein said the new software, which will run on a variety of devices and is priced at $45 per student a year, includes videos, games and vocabulary apps and allows teachers to track student writing and give feedback directly online. “This is not a bunch of souped-up PDFs,” Mr. Klein said, referring to digital versions of print documents.</p>

<p>McGraw Hill, the textbook publisher, will also announce this week that it has signed a partnership with StudySync, a company that creates digital English curriculum tools that have been deployed in 22,000 classrooms and are priced at about a third of Amplify’s rate.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/magazine/no-child-left-untableted.html?pagewanted=all">No Child Left Untableted</a></p>

<blockquote><p>The key, he said, is personalized learning — breaking free of the mass-production model, tailoring the curriculum to the student and redesigning it around proven competence rather than accrued face time, so that each student can go at his own pace. “Now your job is not to dispense knowledge,” Britt told the trainees. “It’s to facilitate learning. No longer is the teacher the bottleneck between students and knowledge. Rather, the teacher architects the environment — in the classroom, on the tablet, online, everywhere.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Textbook efficiency:</p>

<blockquote><p>When I asked Arne Duncan, the U. S. secretary of education, about the increasing amounts of money being spent by school systems on educational technology, he said: “We spend precious taxpayer money now on textbooks, buses, milk, all kinds of things. The real question is, ‘How do you spend more effectively?’ ” Electronic readers could make textbooks better and cheaper, he said. “As a country we spend $7 billion to $8 billion a year on textbooks. My simple question is, ‘Why?’ ” Referring to the six-year textbook-adoption cycle some states still use, Duncan said, “That’s a Neanderthal system.”</p></blockquote>

<p>GigaOm has a good <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/02/25/how-khan-academy-is-using-design-to-pave-the-way-for-the-future-of-education/">take on the design of Khan Academy</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Since its founding in 2008 by former hedge fund analyst Salman Khan — who was making math videos in his spare time to tutor his cousins — Khan Academy has emerged as a new way to learn; one that is self paced, approachable, conversational and tries to help students master individual subjects before moving onto the next. Bill Gates is a big fan, as is Google and its chairman Eric Schmidt as well as Netflix CEO Reed Hastings — all of these big names invested in the company.</p>

<p>While millions of users access the site and watch its content, 30,000 classrooms also use the videos for in-school teaching and teachers (they call them coaches) can also use the software to track student progress. All of these moving parts are tied together by an understated design ethos that highlights simplicity, puts the content first, and tries remove frustration and friction from learning.</p></blockquote>

<p>Audrey Watters has a good roundup of the politics of the &#8220;Open&#8221; label being applied beyond open source tech, especially in Ed-Tech where &#8220;open&#8221; online courses <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/12/16/top-ed-tech-trends-2013-open/">more commonly means &#8221;<strong>open for business</strong>&#8221;</a>. She has an extensive discussion of MOOC hype <a href="http://hackeducation.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=ed-tech%20trends%202013">in a 2013 rundown</a> that is well worth a read.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Great article in <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/11/sir-david-attenborough-enough-with-the-creationists-and-climate-change-deniers.html">The Daily Beast</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Sir David Attenborough is one of the great naturalists of our time, celebrated for decades of peerless documentary making, an infectious love of the animal kingdom and that distinctive and enthusiastic whisper. Once criticized by campaigners for his reticence to address contentious issues, Attenborough is no longer willing to speak in hushed tones.</p>

<p>Sitting opposite the kangaroo enclosure at London Zoo, he told The Daily Beast he had lost patience with the “ignorance” of creationists, polluters, and climate change deniers. “To simply say that you must accept unquestioningly what you learned at your mother’s knee is not the act of an intelligent person,” he said.</p></blockquote>

<p>He vents his frustration with religious zealots</p>

<blockquote><p>Every society in the world has found it necessary to produce a story to account for the fact that humanity is on earth,” he said. “The Australian Aboriginals think that the first humans were regurgitated by a great rainbow serpent in the sky, the people in Thailand think the beginning of the world was a huge pool of milk and a snake was pulled by demons, and the milk coagulated and that formed human beings and there was a time, two and a half to three thousand years ago, when people on the east end of the Mediterranean thought woman was made from the rib of the first man.</p>

<p>“If somebody says to me I believe every word of the Bible is true, you can’t argue against that degree of irrationality…there is actually a way of looking at the natural world and seeing the evidence and it’s all there. And what’s more it’s the same evidence whether it’s in Australia or Northern Europe or wherever. It’s all the same—it all produces the same answer and you can all see the evidence—if you reject that then there’s nothing I can say.”</p></blockquote>

<p>David Attenborough has produced many great programs on evolution, one of the recent ones is <em><a href="http://www.riseofanimals.com/">The Rise of Animals</a></em>, currently showing on ABC1</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Government propagandists for Customs are now broadacasting that asylum seekers will <a href="http://www.customs.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/Storyboard-Afghanistan.pdf">suffer physical and mental harm in detention camps</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/customs-propaganda.jpg"></p>

<p>The Australian public is being kept in the dark like never before about the number of boat arrivals and the conditions of the detention camps. The public is allowed to know that the camps <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-28/immigration-department-breaks-down-asylum-detention-costs/4718730">cost $1.5 billion each year to operate</a>, but the government has effectively denied Australian journalists any real coverage of the conditions in the camps. The politically motivated <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/expulsion-from-nauru-false-and-ridiculous-exiled-judge-20140121-316xa.html">expulsion of a judge from Nauru</a> before an inquiry into their detention camps is another way in which secrecy is being maintained.</p>

<p>The Abbott government claims that they have a mandate to &#8220;stop the boats.&#8221; It&#8217;s unclear if the people that gave them that mandate understand what is happening with their money, in their name.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Bill Nye recently debated the world&#8217;s leading apologist for Young Earth Creationism, Ken Ham. Ham believes that nothing can ever dispove a 6,000 year old earth, and that <a href="www.awkwardmomentsbible.com/unicorns/">unicorns are real animals</a>. Many atheists and scientists opposed the debate, as they were concerned it would legitimise pseudoscience as worthy of scientific consideration, and give money to Ham to build his full scale &#8220;replica&#8221; of the ark. After the event most commentators decided that Ham shot himself in the foot by relying on the bible, but admitting that his beliefs will never change:</p>

<div class="youtube-lazy-link-info">Ken Ham Defeats Himself In 90 Seconds</div>
</a>
<div class="video-info" >Did you guys see the debate between Bill Nye VS Ken Ham? Bill Nye did not even need to show up because Ken Ham was nice enough to totally defeat himself in humiliating fashion.

If you enjoy my work. Please consider picking up a T-shirt from http://www.cultofdusty.com . Not only do you get an awesome atheist shirt but the support is the only reason new content is able to be made. Thanks guys.</div>

<p>Ken Ham admitted that creationism was not a scientific position by conceding that it had never made any predictions about the natural world, and it isn&#8217;t falsifiable. 92% of respondents on a <a href="http://www.christiantoday.com/article/bill.nye.vs.ken.ham.debate.live.stream.free.watch.online.creation.vs.evolution.debate.here.start.time/35688.htm">poll in ChristianityToday</a> thought that Bill Nye won the debate, and Pat Robertson said that the idea that &#8220;it all came about in 6,000 years is nonsense&#8221; and &#8220;let&#8217;s not make a joke of ourselves&#8221;</p>

</div>


<p>Slate notes that HBO is airing a documentary about the <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/02/creationism_is_dangerous_hbo_documentary_questioning_darwin_shows_how_fundamentalism.html">rise of creationism in America</a>, with the following quote from a pastor:</p>

<blockquote><p>“If somewhere in the Bible I were to find a passage that says two plus two equals five,” the pastor states plainly, “I wouldn’t question what I’m reading in the Bible. I would believe it—accept it as true and then do my best to work it out and to understand it.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The problem is that the bible asks belivers to think that pi is 3 in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+7%3A23&amp;version=KJV">1 Kings</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>And he made a molten sea, <strong>ten cubits</strong> from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of <strong>thirty cubits did compass it</strong> round about.</p></blockquote>

<p>Biblical literalists have a range of bogus explanations for why these numbers are true, without embracing the idea that mathematics is wrong. We don&#8217;t call someone a theistic mathematician if they believe in the accuracy of pi, or a theistic meteorologist if they believe rain comes from clouds rather than storehouses in heaven. The mythical beasts that were included in the King James Bible, like <a href="http://classic.net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=Satyr">Satyrs</a>, <a href="http://classic.net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=unicorn">Unicorns</a> and <a href="http://classic.net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=cockatrice">Cockatrices</a> have mostly been retranslated in modern bibles. It was said in relation to the Nephilim that &#8221;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_Giant">There&#8217;s a sucker born every minute</a>&#8221; and most people find the mythical creatures laughable:</p>

<p><img src="/images/bible-dinosaur.jpg"></p>

<p>Other than the occasional <a href="http://galileowaswrong.com/">hick</a>, nobody challenges the heliocentric model, and the flat earth society seems to have fallen over the edge of the disc. Other than <a href="/blog/2013/10/12/plait-spherist/">Phil Plait</a>, nobody decries the spherist bias in the media. Evolution is one of the only areas where children are encouraged to disrupt their science classes, and United States legislatures are trying to encourage the teaching of nonsense. Creationists have managed to get <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/02/09/the_scary_future_of_creationism_in_america/">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> in federal funding in Australia to persue their secterian agenda, and are set to introduce creationism as an &#8220;alternate perspective&#8221; into the history curriculum during the national curriculum review.</p>

<p>Bill Nye&#8217;s biggest appeal in his debate was that for Western countries to be globally competitive in the 21st century, we need to empower science educators to give children a love of learning that will prepare them to be innovators in the rapidly changing technology sector. Religiously and politically motivated campaigns instead want to cast doubt about scientific consensus on topics like evolution and climate change, and are well financed to do so. Anyone with a love of science needs to fight the underhanded campaigns that are trying undermine science education in school classrooms.</p>

<time datetime="2014-02-10T00:09:00+11:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 10<span>th</span>, 2014</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Interesting report on <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2378590">SSRN</a> on the use of tech in schoos, and the youth perspectives on network restrictions and monitoring. Students expressed frustration at the top down focus on technology; &#8220;while many participants reported positive feelings around the current state of technology in their schools, some students seemed frustrated about ongoing initiatives to provide them with tablets for academic purposes. Several participants stated that they would have preferred new laptops to new tablets.&#8221; Some students expressed frustration at inequalities between the ICT resources of different schools.</p>

<p>78% of young people now have a cell phone, and almost <a href="http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Teens-and-Tech.aspx">half (47%) of those own smartphones</a>. A large number of students refuse to hand in their devices, even though they don&#8217;t plan to use them in school hours. A number of students felt frustrated at the disconnect between ICT policy and the concept of the school trusting their students. Some students use Wifi networks from neighbouring buildings because of speed constraints, and blocking of websites that have information on news topics like rapes in India. The schools need to follow Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) guidelines, which don&#8217;t include the blocking of social media sites, even though most schools include it. More public schools than private schools block sites like youtube, which has both &#8220;distracting&#8221; and objectionable content, as well as educational content. Some students found that blocking Facebook blocked educational sites like Khan Academy that use OAuth to login. Students that saved homework on personal email accounts weren&#8217;t able to access them from some school networks.</p>

<p>37% of students admit to bypassing filtering themselves, with simple workarounds like SSL/TLS sites allowed. Some students use VPNs on their own devices. Blocking encrypted tunneling is beyond most school ICT administrators, and there&#8217;s a growing recognition that censorship in institutions like public libraries <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/09/cost-censorship-libraries-10-years-under-childrens-internet-protection-act">is ineffective and curtails free speech</a>. In a telling statement, one student reveals that teachers sometimes ask their students how to bypass filters.</p>

<p>One of the most problematic issues in the paper is the privacy issue. Schools have legitimate reasons to use screen sharing tools to prevent disruptive behaviour, but this also gives teachers mostly unaccountable access to record private student communications. Most of the privacy protections are in school policy, rather than in the technology itself.</p>

<p>Students have a range of legitimate reasons to bypass censorship, and legitimate concerns around their own privacy. Schools have opened up as a new front in the classic war of <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/23/civilwar.html">users vs owners</a>. The shift from from centrally controlled mainframes to user centric PC&#8217;s brought a raft of security issues before <em>some</em> smartphone and tablet vendors moved to a walled garden approach.</p>

<p>ITU figures show that mobile broadband subscriptions are one of the fastest growing sectors in telecomms:</p>

<div class="figure"><a href="http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2013-e.pdf"><img src="/images/itu-2013.png" link="http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2013-e.pdf"><p></span></a></div>


<p>It seems like the only way to be sure that your kid is getting the full educational benefit of the internet without being monitored is to buy them a mobile broadband subscription and send them to a private school. And then ask yourself why on earth we have a digital divide.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The curiosity rover has shot an image of the sky in mars, with Earth appearing as a <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/07/curiosity_sends_back_pale_blue_dot_picture_of_earth_from_mars/">tiny speck of light</a>
<img src="/images/pale-blue-dot-mars.jpg"></p>

<p>When you hear about <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2014/02/06/an-open-letter-to-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-a-young-stranger-six-thousand-miles-and-a-dozen-years-away-2/">four year olds vowing to slaughter their enemies</a> in a war that has claimed the lives of <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-06/102c000-children-killed-in-syrian-civil-war3a-un-report/5241448">10,000 children</a> think about how great the bloodshed is over control of such a tiny fraction of such a small planet. Shane Smith <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOndtUcRXdU&amp;list=PLw613M86o5o5BNP8ls1TNDLLHVEi1Mopg&amp;t=11m18s">notes</a> that at the same time as people are looking at the surface of mars on their smartphones, uneducated Afghan boys are being used in suicide attacks against civilians on Muslim holy days.</p>

<p>It brings to mind one of Carl Sagan&#8217;s most <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9TIeuBF9Ss">famous speeches</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Look again at that dot. That&#8217;s here. That&#8217;s home. That&#8217;s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every &#8220;superstar,&#8221; every &#8220;supreme leader,&#8221; every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</p>

<p>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.</p>

<p>Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.</p>

<p>The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.</p>

<p>It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we&#8217;ve ever known.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Callum Southerland&#8217;s long version of the film is worth watching:</p>

- BBC&#8217;s Walking with Cavemen
- BBC&#8217;s Wonders of the Solar System with Brian Cox
- Carl Sagan&#8217;s Cosmos
- Discovery&#8217;s Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking

The music is &#8220;The Science of Faith&#8221;, &#8220;La Fleur&#8221; and &#8220;For Love of the Dame&#8221; by Michael Giacchino from the Lost soundtrack.

The Carl Sagan Tribute Series will continue, please subscribe to my channel if you wish to be among the first to see my newest videos.
