  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a great article in the New York Times about how politicians and the public in Hawaii are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/us/on-hawaii-a-lonely-quest-for-facts-about-gmos.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=2&amp;">refusing to listen to scientists about how Genetically Modified organisms are safe to eat</a>. It links to a great graph from boingboing pointing out the fallacy of <a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/01/01/correlation-between-autism-dia.html">confusing corellation with causation</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/organic-autism.png" title="A facile corellation shown between organic food sales and autism diagnoses" ></p>

<p>Science Magazine is one of the bastions of reason, with Nobel lauriets signing an open letter denouncing the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6152/1320.full">destruction of test crops</a></p>

<blockquote><p>New technologies often evoke rumors of hazard. These generally fade with time when, as in this case, no real hazards emerge. But the anti-GMO fever still burns brightly, fanned by electronic gossip and well-organized fear-mongering that profits some individuals and organizations. We, and the thousands of other scientists who have signed the statement of protest, stand together in staunch opposition to the violent destruction of required tests on valuable advances such as Golden Rice that have the potential to save millions of impoverished fellow humans from needless suffering and death.</p></blockquote>

<p>Others, such as the co-Founder of Greenpeace, Dr. Patrick Moore, have spoken out against the group&#8217;s increasingly hysterical <a href="http://www.allowgoldenricenow.org/moral-compass">opposition to GM crops like Golden Rice</a>:</p>

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Phil Zuckerman recently took part in a debate with David Marshall on whether religion or secularism is a better basis for a civil society. After <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/phil-zuckerman/adventure-in-christian-in_b_4124618.html">initially refusing to post the video online</a> because they thought Zuckerman won, the church caved and the <a href="http://vimeo.com/77532575">video is up</a>.</p>

<div class="youtube-lazy-link-div"></div>
<div class="youtube-lazy-link-info">The Great Debate: Marshall vs. Zuckerman (Christianity vs. Secular Humanism)</div>
</a>
<div class="video-info" >Does Christianity or secular humanism provide a better foundation for civil society? That is the question that is going to addressed between two scholars, Dr. David Marshall and Dr. Phillip Zuckerman, a Christian and an atheist.

David Marshall is the founder and director of the Kuai Mu Institute for Christianity and World Cultures, and the author of four books, including The Truth Behind the New Atheism: Responding to the Emerging Challenges to God and Christianity (Harvest House Publishers).

Phil Zuckerman is a professor of sociology and secular studies at Pitzer College in Claremont, CA. He is the author most recently of Faith No More: Why People Reject Religion (Oxford University Press, 2011) and Society Without God (NYU Press, 2008).</div>
</div>


<p>Zuckerman stuck to the facts about why largely secular post-Chrsitian societies around the world are doing better on most indicators than the most religious societies, while Marshall presented weak anecdotes of individual conversion experiences and straw men about how communists and vikings are bad people. The pastor of the church said &#8220;It just didn&#8217;t go the way we wanted it to go. We were not represented well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zuckerman has noted that many European societies that score well on social indicators also have <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/170356660/Phil-Zuckerman">low rates of Chrsitian belief</a>. Only 18% of Swedes believe in heaven, 10% believe in hell and 3% believe that the Bible is the literal word of God, among the lowest rates in the world. In Denmark, women&#8217;s labour force participation doubled in the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s, rapidly changing the model of femininity valued by young women. Social changes like these supported by neoliberal governments, including the banning of prosletyzing in schools, and the provision of free healthcare to all have quickly caused generational decline in religion as the state Lutheran church struggles to market itself.</p>

<p>Zuckerman eloquently criticised the bible belt states for high rates of divorce, teen pregnancy, sexual assault, diabetes, child abuse, unemployment and murder. He has a long history of criticising the political hypocrisy of the white evangelical power base, that claims evolution is wrong, but <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/phil-zuckerman/why-evangelicals-hate-jes_b_830237.html">tend to support policies that could be described as &#8220;Social Darwinism.&#8221;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>The results from a recent poll <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/Politics-and-Elections/Tea-Party-and-Religion.aspx">published by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life</a> reveal what social scientists have known for a long time: White Evangelical Christians are the group least likely to support politicians or policies that reflect the actual teachings of Jesus.</p></blockquote>

<p>Zuckerman has an excellent analysis of the <a href="http://www.edge.org/conversation/why-the-gods-are-not-winning">global decline of faith</a> on Edge.org. One interesting fact about the general decline of Chrstianity in America is how gender plays a factor in mixed faith households:</p>

<blockquote><p>Rather than Amerofaith becoming deeply patriarchal as Longman thinks, it is increasingly feminine. Women church goers greatly outnumber men, who find church too dull. Here&#8217;s the kicker. Children tend to pick up their beliefs from their fathers. So, despite a vibrant evangelical youth cohort, young Americans taken as a whole are the least religious and most culturally tolerant age group in the nation.</p></blockquote>

<p>He notes that the well resourced churches are consolidating believers rather than expanding the faithful</p>

<blockquote><p>Even the megachurch phenomenon is illusory. A spiritual cross of sports stadiums with theme parks, hi-tech churches are a desperate effort to pull in and satisfy a mass-media jaded audience for whom the old sit in the pews and listen to the standard sermon and sing some old time hymns does not cut it anymore. Rather than boosting church membership, megachurches are merely consolidating it.</p></blockquote>

<p>While Zuckerman notes that he was well remunerated for travelling to take part in the professionally recorded debate, the decision of the church to initially refuse to publish the video demonstrates that content matters more than its presentation. The trend of religion being on the nose for the last hundred years will continue as churches struggle to cover up their mistakes in an age of social media, no matter how well they learn to speak with &#8216;Gen Y&#8217;.</p>

This came at a time when his staff were facing funding cuts because of a savings plan instituted a principle of austerity in the church.</p>

German dioceses are chafing under the new plans, which would reveal to their donors just how well-off they are.</p>

<p>As reported in the Religion News Service, German dioceses are among the world&#8217;s welthiest, and the diocese of Cologne is <a href="http://www.religionnews.com/2013/10/23/bishops-suspension-symptom-german-catholic-churchs-wealth/">richer than the Vatican</a>. By law, Germans registered as Catholics must give 8-10% of their tax revenue to the church, which gave the church $7.1 US billion in 2012. Even as over 100,000 members leave the church every year following child sex abuse scandals, the dioceses still have enormous asset reserves.</p>

<p>While the new Argentinian pope travells on a bus or in a donated 20 year old Renault his obstinate German subordinantes refuse to give up their BMWs and Audis. The previous pope took up a yearly collection of <a href="https://opentabernacle.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/popes-personal-income-200-million-annually/">$200 million US</a>, which will certainly guarantee him a comfortable life in retirement, while the new pope has opted to live in a single room in a guesthouse rather than his papal apartment.</p>

<blockquote><p>“The German Catholic Church is one of the country’s wealthiest and largest organizations and its top officials expect a certain lifestyle,” said Carsten Frerk, who has published two books on the German churches’ wealth and what he describes as their opaque financing. “But they are wary of the extent of their wealth becoming broadly known because it might lead to fewer donations.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Francis has commented that he <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/01/pope-francis-interview_n_4023659.html?utm_hp_ref=religion">dislikes careerist priests</a>, stating “It also happens to me that when I meet a clericalist, I suddenly become anti-clerical. Clericalism should not have anything to do with Christianity.”</p>

<p>Francis had stated in September that the Catholic Church was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24166434">too focussed on sexual issues</a> like homosexuality, abortion and contraception, and they must increase their focus on the poor and marginalised. This has apparently had little effect in the US, where the US Conference of Catholic Bishops <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/10/18/1248662/-Shutdown-losers-include-Catholic-Bishops">campaigned for Republicans to introduce religious priviliges</a> into the &#8216;must pass&#8217; resolution to end the government shutdown and avert a US government default. The shutdown cost 800,000 jobs and left poor families without food stamps for weeks, and resulted in the Republican party hitting the lowest approval rating of any political party recorded by Gallup. The government shutdown over Obamacare appears to be a <a href="http://thecontributor.com/religion/how-catholic-bishops-pushed-shutdown-%E2%80%93-and-even-default-%E2%80%93-over-birth-control">long-planned offensive from the USCCB</a>, with their opposition to Obamacare <a href="http://publicreligion.org/2012/08/as-catholics-go-so-goes-the-nation/">parroted by the Romney campaign</a>.</p>

<p>In Victoria, local communities are devastated that the Uniting Church is selling off between <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-17/730-anglican-church-story/5029694">$32 million</a> and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-11/uniting-church-puts-properties-up-for-sale-to-clear-debts/5015754">$100 million</a> worth of church properties to cover debts accumulated by the failure of Acacia College. The Church is considering selling <a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/north/ivanhoe-east-church-on-the-market-as-uniting-church-liquidates-properties/story-fnglenug-1226741089815">56 properties</a> after they had had run up $10 million dollars in debt because of legal issues with the developer, and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-10-18/catholic-church-considers-buying-acacia-college/4321504">unexpected infrastructure costs</a>.</p>

<p>While megachurches like Hillsong make <a href="www.heraldsun.com.au/money/money-matters/tax-office-push-for-charity-monitoring/story-fn312ws8-1225896551630">over $50 million dollars a year in tax-free profits</a>, paying their leaders more than $1.5 million a year, most small churches founded on volunteerism and support for charities have their supporter base dying off, with none of the flashy showmanship that attracts rich idiots into the Pentecostal churches.</p>

<p>Many of the parishioners were shocked to find that the churches they had been volunteering in and donating to for years, and for some, decades, were soon to be sold off. This is not the first time that local churches have been asked to bear the brunt of financial losses after a central church body loses millions. The Sydney Anglican church lost over $100 million by <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/millions-wiped-out-by-church-gambles-20090609-c29m.html">borrowing money to invest in shares before the GFC in 2009</a>, leading it to ask parishioners to take part in a planned but now unfunded evangelical sabotage of the Bible Society&#8217;s Jesus All About Life campaign. In February the Los Angeles Catholic diocese, after having paid $660 million dollars to settle more than 500 child sexual abuse cases <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/deaconsbench/2013/02/los-angeles-considering-capital-campaign-to-raise-200-million/">asked their parishioners for $200 million</a> for &#8220;repair and upkeep of our parish churches and schools.&#8221; This is after they had already managed to misappropriate $115 million from a grave maintenance fund <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/wwjtd/2013/02/the-los-angeles-diocese-found-some-new-funds/">into paying off child sexual assault victims</a>, without the knowledge or consent of the donors.</p>

<p>Most religionists would be completely shocked to find that the religion they&#8217;ve been trying to follow is completely different to the religion that their leaders use to gain money and power.</p>

<h3>Wider resentment of Prosperity Theology</h3>

<p>While in Germany the revelation of lying, selfish preachers is a scandal, in the US it&#8217;s nothing new. Peter Popoff was making $4 million a year when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Popoff">James Randi exposed him as a fraud</a>, and Bobby Tilton may have made as much as $80 million a year when he was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Tilton">found to be dumping the prayer requests his ministry took donations for</a>. The new Reality TV show Preachers of LA shows the glitzy and glamorous lives of Ferrari and Bentley driving pastors who fully embrace Prosperity Theology. Bishop Ron Gibson, with whom he had a child out of wedlock, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10406467/Meet-the-real-bishops-of-bling-the-Californian-preachers-of-prosperity-theology.html">boasts that fancy cars are not just for materialistic rappers</a></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;P Diddy and Jay-Z - they&#8217;re not the only ones who should be driving Ferraris and living in large houses,&#8221; he says to the camera as he compares himself to secular celebrities. To whoops from his congregation, he notes: &#8220;You see my bling, you see my Bentley, you see my glory but you don&#8217;t see my story.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `[]&#8217; for nil:NilClass</p>

<p>Baptist Pastors have a long history of playing their parishioners for mugs. Mark Barclay, a self proclaimed &#8220;Preacher of Righteousness&#8221; recently asked his followers for $79,000 for a paint job on his private jet, saying &#8221;<a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/televangelist-asks-followers-for-79k-to-do-paint-job-on-lords-jet-he-bought-last-year-98435/">the airplane does belong to Him [God] and not me and is used for His ministry and not personal use</a>.&#8221; He had the gall to cite Jesus&#8217;s words &#8220;do not store up treasures for yourself&#8221; to justify why his members should &#8220;sow&#8221; offerings for his million dollar jet.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a growing tide of criticism of prosperity theology. In a statement, Professor Stanley Hauerwas denounced the $1.7 million home of pastor Steve Furtick saying &#8220;It&#8217;s just vulgar. It&#8217;s an offense to the Gospel.&#8221; A number of media outlets are criticising pastors with private jets in <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2220833/Laughing-private-jet--93m-pastor-accused-exploiting-British-worshippers.html">Nigeria</a> and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andersonantunes/2013/01/17/the-richest-pastors-in-brazil/">Brazil</a>. A pastor who promised parishioners a miraculous new car if they would donate $52,000 for new blades for his private helicopter has lashed out at the media for publicizing the campaign, but not before widespread denunciation.</p>

<div class="youtube-lazy-link-info">Exclusive: Lee Atwater&#8217;s Infamous 1981 Interview on the Southern Strategy</div>
</a>
<div class="video-info" >In 1981, the legendarily brutal campaign consultant Lee Atwater, after a decade as South Carolina&#8217;s most effective Republican operative, was working in Ronald Reagan&#8217;s White House when he was interviewed by Alexander Lamis, a political scientist at Case Western Reserve University. 

In this audio, made public for the first time ever, Atwater lays out how Republicans can win the vote of racists without sounding racist themselves. Listen to the full audio and read Rick Perlstein&#8217;s analysis here: http://tnat.in/ffHKS</div>
</div>


<p>It has become, for liberals and leftists enraged by the way Republicans never suffer the consequences for turning electoral politics into a cesspool, a kind of smoking gun. The late, legendarily brutal campaign consultant Lee Atwater explains how Republicans can win the vote of racists without sounding racist themselves:
 
You start out in 1954 by saying, “Nigger, nigger, nigger.” By 1968 you can’t say “nigger”—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.… “We want to cut this,” is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than “Nigger, nigger.”
 
Now, the same indefatigable researcher who brought us Mitt Romney’s “47 percent” remarks, James Carter IV, has dug up the entire forty-two-minute interview from which that quote derives. Here, The Nation publishes it in its entirety for the very first time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently the LA Times has made waves with news that they <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-climate-change-letters-20131008,0,871615.story">censor untrue assertions from their opinion pages</a>. Astronomer Phil Plait writes to the LA Times to complain about their blatant spherist bias, and their failure to <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/10/10/an_open_letter_to_the_l_a_times_editors.html">teach the controversy on the flattness of the earth</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear L.A. Times Editors:
It has come to my attention that you will no longer be publishing letters to the editor from Flat-Earthers. This is an outrage, and shows your obvious spherist bias.</p>

<p>By taking the stance that the Earth is round, you are going against six thousand years of obvious truth. Look around you! Do you see the world curving down, away from you? Of course not. And the idea that we live on a thin skin of crust outside a giant sea of molten rock is simply ridiculous. If that were true, the ground would be warmer than the air above it! Duh.</p>

<p>The claim of a scientific consensus is another orbist lie. Have you not seen the Global Flattening Petition Project, which is signed by thousands of scientists* who know the true unbent shape of our planet? And don’t forget Geocentrismgate, where scientists’ emails revealed they say “The Moon rises at 8:30 tonight,” showing they clearly have been lying about heliocentrism, too.</p></blockquote>
