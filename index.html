  <div class="entry-content"><p>Good post on the <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/thinking-mistakes-8-common-mistakes-in-how-we-think-and-how-to-avoid-them">Buffer blog on cognitive errors</a>. There&#8217;s good discussion of Dan Ariely&#8217;s work on anchoring and pricing, as well as this classic about the conjuction fallacy:</p>

<blockquote><p>In 1983 Kahneman and Tversky tested how illogical human thinking is by describing the following imaginary person:</p>

<blockquote><p>Linda is thirty-one years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in antinuclear demonstrations.</p></blockquote>

<p>The researchers asked people to read this description, and then asked them to answer this question:</p>

<p>Which alternative is more probable?</p>

<ol>
<li>Linda is a bank teller.</li>
<li>Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.
Here’s where it can get a bit tricky to understand (at least, it did for me!)—If answer #2 is true, #1 is also true. This means that #2 cannot be the answer to the question of probability.</li>
</ol>


<p>Unfortunately, few of us realize this, because we’re so overcome by the more detailed description of #2. Plus, as the earlier quote pointed out, stereotypes are so deeply ingrained in our minds that subconsciously apply them to others.</p>

<p>Roughly 85% of people chose option #2 as the answer. A simple choice of words can change everything.</p></blockquote>

<p>Adding more detail or extra assumptions can make an event seem more plausible, even though the event necessarily becomes less probable. Kahneman and Tversky tried <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ji/conjunction_fallacy/">another experiment on probabilities</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Consider a regular six-sided die with four green faces and two red faces.  The die will be rolled 20 times and the sequences of greens (G) and reds (R) will be recorded.  You are asked to select one sequence, from a set of three, and you will win $25 if the sequence you chose appears on successive rolls of the die.  Please check the sequence of greens and reds on which you prefer to bet.</p>

<ol>
<li>RGRRR</li>
<li>GRGRRR</li>
<li>GRRRRR</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>65% of respondents chose option 2 as the most likely bet, as it matches the colours of the 6 sides, even though the shorter sequence 1 requires less correct rolls to complete.</p>

<p>Another example of the conjunction fallacy</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>&#8220;A complete suspension of diplomatic relations between the USA and the Soviet Union, sometime in 1983.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;A Russian invasion of Poland, and a complete suspension of diplomatic relations between the USA and the Soviet Union, sometime in 1983.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Most respondents rate 2 as more likely than 1, even though 2 would necessarily entail 1, and it would be possible to have a complete suspension of diplomatic relations between the USA and USSR without invasion of any country, let alone Poland specifically.</p>

<p>If you have the time, consider how you&#8217;d approach a problem like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a> or this classic problem on breast cancer screening:</p>

<blockquote><p>1% of women at age forty who participate in routine screening have breast cancer.  80% of women with breast cancer will get positive mammographies.  9.6% of women without breast cancer will also get positive mammographies.  A woman in this age group had a positive mammography in a routine screening.  What is the probability that she actually has breast cancer?</p></blockquote>

<p>While most doctors give the intuitive answer of 80%, working though with Baysean logic gives the answer of 7.8%. Yudowsky has a <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes">long explanation</a> of the answer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kevin Breel&#8217;s impassioned talk at TEDxKids on depression and the need for honesty has been going around on social media. Depression is a taboo topic, but it&#8217;s important for everyone like myself who don&#8217;t suffer from clinical depression that the stigmatising of mental health issues can be more of a challenge for sufferers than their disease.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Popular Science recently announced that they are shutting down the comments for new articles, as they can skew the readers into <a href="http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-09/why-were-shutting-our-comments">distrusting the expertise of scientists</a>. Recent studies have found that incivility in the comment section can alter the perception of the credibility of the articles they accompany. In one study, readers of a fake blog post on nanotechnology were asked to evaluate it&#8217;s impact, with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/opinion/sunday/this-story-stinks.html?_r=0">one group exposed to vituperative comments</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p> Uncivil comments not only polarized readers, but they often changed a participant&#8217;s interpretation of the news story itself.<br/>
 In the civil group, those who initially did or did not support the technology — whom we identified with preliminary survey questions — continued to feel the same way after reading the comments. Those exposed to rude comments, however, ended up with a much more polarized understanding of the risks connected with the technology.<br/>
 Simply including an ad hominem attack in a reader comment was enough to make study participants think the downside of the reported technology was greater than they&#8217;d previously thought.</p></blockquote>

<p>In a world where more and more discussion of contemporary issues happens online, this does not bode well for the public understanding of the importance of science, alread <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/opinion/welcome-to-the-age-of-denial.html">at all time lows</a>. As people search out information about health online, &#8220;Dr Google&#8221; can mislead patients and present <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/bigideas/stories/2011/04/28/3202794.htm">debunked information wrongly suggesting that vaccines don&#8217;t work</a>. A decentralised media landscape should have the ability to route around authoritarian regimes that try to censor it, but what happens when it undermines the structures that support the public respect of useful institutions?</p>

<p>Carl Sagan fundamentaly believed that the populace deserved to be educated about science, so that political or religious charlatans wouldn&#8217;t lure them into the next deception. Noting that either the people control the government or the government controls the people, he fiercely advocated that the science of evolution be taught in public schools so that the people could choose to understand science for themselves:</p>

<p>Benkler, in his 2006 book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Networks">The Wealth of Networks</a> portended a networked society enriched by freely available peer-produced cultural works in a shared online commons like wikipedia. The utipian visions of such an information ecosystem, however, have to be reconciled with the reality that most people are unaware of their own cognitive biases, and are increasingly polarised on science and other issues in the management of polities. Without educating people on cognative biases and getting them to understand the world as it is, not as they want it to be, then potentially a decentrilised internet will simply fracture people into tribal teams who all see things the same way. Unfortunately, some content algorithms are set up to give users content <a href="http://www.thefilterbubble.com/ted-talk">similar to what they&#8217;ve already seen</a> potentially limiting their exposure to information that contradicts their beliefs. Similarly, asking a search engine to find information on &#8220;global warming <em>science</em>&#8221; or &#8220;global warming <em>conspiracy</em>&#8221; may find different sets of sites, without the questioner perceiving any bias in their own question, and assuming that the results they see are representitive of the information as a whole.</p>

<p>In conclusion to all of this, the reason I don&#8217;t have comments is that like Popular Science, I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re particularly helpful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Pope Francis has recently made international headlines by suggesting <a href="www.americamagazine.org/pope-interview">that the Catholic Church is too focused on gays and abortion</a>. This follows from his earlier comments that <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/pope-francis-assures-atheists-you-dont-have-to-believe-in-god-to-go-to-heaven-8810062.html">atheists who follow their conscience might be able to go to heaven</a> and that he isn&#8217;t in a position to judge <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/pope-on-gay-priests-who-am-i-to-judge-20130730-2qvh9.html">celibate gay Catholics</a>. This is a major turnaround from the culture war style dealings with the public the church pushed under Benedict, culminating in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Declaration:_A_Call_of_Christian_Conscience">Manhattan Declaration</a>&#8217;s popularity.</p>

<p>Most of the current culture war issues revolve around <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/category/topics/feminism">gender politics</a>, and these disputes likely go back to the start of the church. This history channel documentary presents expert opinions on New Testament apocrypha, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Paul_and_Thecla">Acts of Paul and Thecla</a></p>

<div class="video-info" >Travel back to the blistering sands of the Holy Land, into the onion-domed chapels of Eastern Orthodox churches and onto the pages of the Koran. Unearth the trail of chapters that were left out of the ultimate version of the Scriptures. Included in the Koran is &#8220;The Life of Adam and Eve,&#8221; a detailed account of the creation story written before Jesus was born. The incestuous account of &#8220;The Book of Jubilees&#8221; was included in the Orthodox Old Testament and the Dead Sea Scrolls. &#8220;The Book of Enoch,&#8221; an ancient bestseller, relates the story of the man said in Genesis to have walked with God and been assumed directly into heaven. This fascinating collection offers a fresh perspective on the figures at the foundation of faith.</div>
</div>


<p>Thecla, as <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/maps/primary/thecla.html">the story goes</a>, was a student of Paul&#8217;s that loved his preaching on asceticism and celibacy. After telling her fiance that she was no longer interested in marrying him, he became furious and sought out Paul to demand he stop teaching that virgins should remain chaste. He raised a multitude of angry husbands who were furious their wives stopped wanting sex, and brought Paul and Thecla to the governor, who condemned Paul to flogging and and Thecla to burning at the stake as a warning against their teachings. While Thecla was being brought to her pyre, she looked around for Paul, and saw in the crowd a vision of Jesus who ascended to heaven. Fixing her gaze on heaven as the pyre was lit, a miraculous hailstorm extinguished the flames, saving her. I find it interesting that while this story is entirely fictional, it has a number of similarities to the death of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_of_arc">Joan of Arc</a>.</p>

<p>Paul, it is said, then allowed Thecla to travel with him throughout the land, so long as she didn&#8217;t let her looks tempt the people. In Antioch, an magistrate called Alexander was taken with her, and grabbed her and kissed her as his way of proposition. Vowed to chastity, Thecla responded by knocking the crown off his head and ripping his cloak open so as to humiliate him in front of the people he ruled. Ashamed, Alexander took her to the governor who ordered her be thrown to the lions. Alexander had support from the men of the town, but the women of the town felt sympathy for the virgin and felt the punishment unjust. Before being cast into the amphitheatre to confront her fate, Thecla cried out in faith to her god to protect her innocence, and a she-lion fiercer than all the beasts fell down before her. The she-lion then killed the beasts that attacked Thecla, including male lions and a she-bear. This is probably a reference to Elisha&#8217;s she-bears, and Daniel&#8217;s lions.</p>

<div class="figure"><a href="http://dashinvaine.deviantart.com/art/Thecla-in-the-Arena-373006770"><img src="/images/thecla-lions.jpg" link="http://dashinvaine.deviantart.com/art/Thecla-in-the-Arena-373006770" title="Thecla and the lions by Gordon Napier" ><p>Thecla and the lions by Gordon Napier</span></a></div>


<p>Next Thecla decided to baptise herself in a pool of sharks. Upon baptising herself in the name of Jesus, the sharks were struck with fire and lightning, and she was protected with a ring of fire. The women threw ointments into the field to knock out the other animals, so Alexander brought in his strongest bulls to have Thecla tied to. So the governor&#8217;s men tied a rope around Thecla&#8217;s waist to bulls that became enraged when hit by a hot poker in the nads. But the divine fire around Thecla burned off the rope fastened to the members of the bulls. When a powerful widow and relative of Caesar collapsed with worry for Thecla, the governor put an end to her trials fearing for his reputation, and officially pardoned Thecla. Thecla proclaimed the message of Christianity, converting many young men and women, and dressed as a man, led her new followers to find Paul who had run off amongst the commotion.</p>

<p>Thecla then went about the land preaching and performing miraculous healings, and set up a monastery where a large number of young women pledged their chastity. Tales of her miracles caused the sick in adjacent countries to travel to her for healing, making the local physicians furious at the competition, so they plotted to kill her. They decided that the virgin priestess must be raped to lose her powers, so conspired to pay local youths to assault her. They announced to her their intent to lie with her, before she cried out to heaven to save her chastity, and she ran into a miraculous fissure in a rock that closed up behind her, saving her one last time.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of things in this story that the early church fathers would have found objectionable, including the claim that Paul preached asceticism. But one of the most interesting things is how virginity went against the culture of the time. The story has Paul preaching that married couples should stay chaste, and while some <a href="http://blackamericaweb.com/129296/christian-couple-maintains-abstinence-two-years-after-marriage/">loopy couples today manage this for two whole years</a> most of the church&#8217;s preaching has changed to pro-natalist ideas. Interestingly, this may only have come after Paul and Jesus, as both believed that an apocalypse was coming in their lifetime, and children were unnecessary. Bart Ehrman has argued in <em>Forged</em> that 1 Thessalonians and parts of 1 Corinthians are a forgery of Pauline writings. This would actually fit with an asceticist Paul being watered down by later authors wanting to focus on childbearing, and making Christianity compatible with the Roman society of the time.</p>

<p>Justin Martyr, facing Roman persecution, presented his argument that Christianity was less of a threat to Roman order than atheistic philosophers like Socrates. The earlier church would have faced similar persecution, and had the similar desire to make Christianity seem compatible with the Roman culture of the time. In Book 1 of Politics Aristotle writes that the hierarchy of the state should be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_code">matched by the &#8220;building block&#8221; of the family</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Seeing then that the state is made up of households, before speaking of the state we must speak of the management of the household. The parts of the household are the persons who compose it, and a complete household consists of slaves and freemen. Now we should begin by examining everything in its least elements; and the first and least parts of a family are master and slave, husband and wife, father and children. We have therefore to consider what each of these three relations is and ought to be:—I mean the relation of master and servant, of husband and wife, and thirdly of parent and child.</p></blockquote>

<p>Plato advocates husbands ruling over their wives, <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Politics_(Jowett)/Book_I#Different_kinds_of_rule_within_the_household:_.281.29_rule_of_master_over_slaves.3B_.282.29_of_father_over_children.3B_.283.29_of_husband_over_wife.">criticising Socrates for advocating for equality between the sexes</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>A husband and father rules over wife and children, both free, but the rule differs, the rule over his children being a royal, over his wife a constitutional rule. For although there may be exceptions to the order of nature, the male is by nature fitter for command than the female, just as the elder and full-grown is superior to the younger and more immature&#8230; moral virtue belongs to all of them; but the temperance of a man and of a woman, or the courage and justice of a man and of a woman, are not, as Socrates maintained, the same; the courage of a man is shown in commanding, of a woman in obeying</p></blockquote>

<p>Philo of Alexandria similarly reflected on the society of his time by documenting the importance of men controlling their families:</p>

<blockquote><p>if you ask any one of them about their national laws or customs, they can all tell you at once, without any difficulty; and the husband appears to be a master, endowed with sufficient authority to explain these laws to his wife, a father to teach them to his children, and a master to his servants.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Many Christian writers would have wanted to make Christianity compatible with these household codes, and the similar decrees that women submit to their husbands, save themselves in childbirth, and never preach (in Colossians, Ephesians, 1 Timothy, Titus and 1 Peter) may be a response to the Roman culture of the time. It may also be a way on clamping down on radical women&#8217;s movement of virgins that would have sprung up in the wake of texts like the Acts of Paul and Thecla, pushing for women to gain power over the men by denying their husbands sex - the one area in which they wielded considerable power. Even in times when women have jobs and education, there is widespread anxiety over the <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2012/06/27/the-ugly-side-of-modesty/">&#8220;sexualisation&#8221; of girls</a>, as though female sexuality is some dangerous, destabilising force.</p>

<p>All non-apocalyptic religions emphasise marriage, childbearing and family. Studies have found that when people are in a room with highly attractive people, they are <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/collections/201107/will-atheism-replace-religion/religious-piety-mating-strategy">more drawn to religious ideas that emphasise monogamy</a>. In nearly every religion, teachings can be conveniently cherry picked to conform to the type of <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2013/06/fck-me-in-the-ass-because-i-love-jesus/">reproductive strategy that the adherent wants to achieve</a>.</p>

<p>Everyone knows the old rule of avoiding bringing up religion and politics in polite company to keep discussions civil. Political disagreements often become pointed and vituperative because people who are otherwise open to new ideas can become defensive when their political views are questioned. While most people believe that others will see things their way if they simply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_deficit_model">had the right information</a>, the reality is that people presented with new information will typically interpret in light of what they already know. A new study from Yale shows just how bad the problem can be, with people <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/09/new-study-politics-makes-you-innumerate">letting their political views get in the way of thinking clearly</a>.</p>

<p>Dan Kahan presented students with a simple number problem, asking them to determine whether a certain intervention improves or worsens a problem. Respondents were presented with one version asking about skin rashes (a neutral problem) and another version asking them about gun control and crime (a deeply polarising ongoing political argument). The respondents were presented with the following table and asked whether the intervention worked:</p>

<p><img src="/images/Kahan1.png"></p>

<p>Figuring out whether the cream works requires computing two ratios, and comparing whether the intervention worked better in the experimental group than the control group. In the experimental group, there is a 3:1 ratio of improvement to worsening, leading to the intuitive answer that the intervention works. But the correct answer is only found when that ratio is compared to the 5:1 improvement in the control group. As I&#8217;ve already written about, people can <a href="/blog/2013/06/12/are-you-a-racist/">make errors in basic maths problems by settling for the intuitive answer</a>, rather than double checking their work to find the correct one.</p>

<p>On average only 41% of respondents got the answer about skin care right, with more numerate respondents getting the answer right more of the time. Unfortunately, with the question on gun control, highly numerate Democrats and Republicans tended to get the answer right when the intuitive answer didn&#8217;t align with their political philosophy, but were unlikely to get the answer right when the intuitive answer agreed with their political philosophy. Kahan&#8217;s data suggests that people with high scientific literacy and numeracy are still likely to misinterpret scientific findings if they agree or disagree with their political biases. Earlier work found that people with a high level of scientific literacy, on average, are <a href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v2/n10/full/nclimate1547.html">more sceptical of climate change</a>, with views more politically polarised the more knowledgeable the individuals are.</p>

<p>When people are presented with information on the risks and opportunities of nanotechnology, those who oppose nuclear power usually oppose nanotechnology, and vice versa, as people interpret new information in line with their pre-existing beliefs. Philosophers and moral leaders have for millennia used parables and metaphors to present new ideas to students, getting them to reason about thought experiments outside of their intuitions about their current situation.</p>

<p>David Hume described reason as the &#8220;slave of the passions&#8221;, and Jonathan Haidt describes human cognition as an emotional elephant with a rational rider. We think with emotions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory#Dual-process_accounts_of_reasoning">faster than we consciously reason with logic</a>. More often than not, the reasons we give for thinking one way or another are post-hoc rationalisations for intuitive emotional judgements. Haidt has suggested that many people see themselves in a tribe, with their own interests in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realistic_conflict_theory">opposition to the other team&#8217;s</a>. People who support certain causes can see their identity as part of a group that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_cognition">believes in similar causes</a>.</p>

<p>So while many people view the divisiveness of political discourse as the fault of the current media landscape, the reality is that these kinds of debates have been going on for all of history. In Emperor Justinius&#8217;s Byzantium in 532, political factions took sides on chariot racing in the Hippodrome. Two major factions existed, the Blues and Greens racing teams, with the Blues receiving support from the Emperor and his faction, and the Greens a more popular team. Consider the historian Procopius&#8217;s view on the <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/procop-wars1.asp">politics of Byzantium in 532</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In every city the population has been divided for a long time past into the Blue and the Green factions; but within comparatively recent times it has come about that, for the sake of these names and the seats which the rival factions occupy in watching the games, they spend their money and abandon their bodies to the most cruel tortures, and even do not think it unworthy to die a most shameful death. And they fight against their opponents knowing not for what end they imperil themselves, but knowing well that, even if they overcome their enemy the fight, the conclusion of the matter for them will be to be carried off straight away to the prison, and finally, after suffering extreme torture, to be destroyed. So there grows up in them against their fellow men a hostility which has no cause, and at no time does it cease or disappear, for it gives place neither to the ties of marriage nor of relationship nor of friendship, and the case is the same even though those who differ with respect to these colours be brothers or any other kin</p></blockquote>

<p><img src="/images/Ben-Hur.jpg" title="Chariot Racing, from Ben Hur" ></p>

<p>The horse races could kill and maim participants, and some of the supporters, in their colours would smuggle weapons into the stadium (that seated 150,000) to start fights with the supporters of the other team. These fights broke out not just because of the sport, but because the tribal identity of the sports teams lead their supporters to fight over political issues, and theological debates coming from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcedonian_Christianity">Fourth Ecumenical council</a>. This culminated in a riot that Procopius estimated <a href="http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/history/2012/03/blue-versus-green-rocking-the-byzantine-empire/">killed up to 30,000</a></p>

<p>Eliazar Yudkowsky has reflected on just how meaningless and pointless these tribal conflicts can be. In a <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/gt/a_fable_of_science_and_politics/">thought experiment I love</a>, he presents a politicised version of Plato&#8217;s cave, inviting reflection on a future society living underground with no vision of the sky. They have only scraps of human history describing a &#8220;cerulean&#8221; sky, and factions of Blues and Greens have fought violently for years over the interpretation of the colour of the sky. After growing exhausted with the constant conflicts over the issue, an uneasy truce develops. People continue to be entrenched into the &#8220;Blue&#8221; or &#8220;Green&#8221; way of thinking about political and cultural issues like taxation, based on battle lines drawn from the original debate.</p>

<p>I highly recommend reading Yudkowsky&#8217;s post in full to understand the power of the metaphor. Briefly, he presents different people reaching the surface and seeing the sky for the first time. For some Blues, the confirmation of a blue sky encourages them to want to break the truce and fight out the issue. For some Greens, the disconfirmation of everything they&#8217;ve lived for crushes them, and they must confront the cruel truth that while the reviled Blues are right. For the professor who&#8217;s always emphasised that both positions could be right, the single colour of the sky is too much of a risk to the harmony of society to embrace. For one Green, the admission that she was wrong for most of her life will hurt her family and leave her with few friends, but her committment to intellectual integrity requires her to announce her changed belief. The final traveller, seeing only the beauty and wonder of the sky, marvels at the new environment and decides to go exploring.</p>

<p>Knowing that political differences arise from the way that people deal with information, rather than a lack of information, leads me to belive that the last traveller probably has the best response. Sometimes you&#8217;ll find new information that other people wouldn&#8217;t accept, and it&#8217;s better just to explore the world without them.</p>

<div class="youtube-lazy-link-info">Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on the Bible, same sex marriage, slavery, discrimination</div>
</a>
<div class="video-info" >The day after PM Kevin Rudd&#8217;s comments on Q&A to a Christian pastor, about same sex marriage and saying that the Bible sees slavery as &#8216;a natural condition&#8217;.

12:30pm, 3 September 2013, Tasmania-

Reporter: Just on your exchange last night with a Christian pastor about same-sex marriage, are you concerned your position on marriage equality risks alienating the Christian vote?

Kevin Rudd: You know something? This is a really interesting example of a question, because it&#8217;s about political perceptions of a given action. I&#8217;m concerned about what we do. I&#8217;m actually concerned about answering directly a question about what we do about all those Australians who are in same-sex relationships, who are asking for a basic exercise of human decency which is called &#8216;marriage equality&#8217;. And so, if it offends some people, so be it. But my job is to say what I am standing up for, what we would do if we are re-elected, and how we would go about doing it. And I&#8217;ve done that. And in my response to that fellow last night, when people start hurling Biblical quotes at me &#8211; I know a bit about my New Testament as well. And as I said last night, if you&#8217;re going to be a serious Biblicist about these questions, we&#8217;d still be supporting slavery in the 21st century, and by the way, to all of you who are women, it says in the New Testament according to St Paul that wives should be submissive to their husbands. So just bear all that in mind, cause it&#8217;s in the Bible. In fact, if we took it that seriously, you know what? We may as well repeal, also, the Sex Discrimination Act because that creates a different set of circumstances. Let&#8217;s get real about this. The core principles are those I outlined last night. And what happens with any civilised country is over time, they apply them to different sets of circumstances. And we did that in the 19th century with slavery, we did that in the 20th century &#8211; far too late &#8211; in terms of the rights of women. 21st century &#8211; we should look at the rights of same-sex couples. These are questions of principle. And therefore they should be addressed firmly as such. And as to their political consequences, that&#8217;s a matter for others. I&#8217;m there to argue a proposition and my reasons for it. I think I did it fairly clearly last night.</div>
</div>


<p>The religious community, of course, is furious that their authority to oppose legislation the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-29/vote-compass-gay-marriage-euthanasia-abortion/4918494">majority of Australians want</a> is questioned by the issue of the relevance of the bible to contemporary society. Sandy Grant has trotted out the tired evangelical claim that the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-03/grant-how-could-a-christian-pm-call-the-bible-pro-slavery/4932422">bible doesn&#8217;t endorse slavery</a> even though it&#8217;s been interpreted that way for most of human history. Grant claims &#8220;Even a cursory reading of the Bible would tell you it never says slavery is a &#8220;natural condition&#8221;. Never. Not once.&#8221; Of course, the Curse of Caanan, commonly called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Ham">Curse of Ham</a> in Genesis 9 says that some races deserve to be the &#8220;least of the slaves&#8221; to the others:</p>

<blockquote><p> Noah, a man of the soil, began to plant a vineyard. <em>21</em> When he drank some of the wine, he got drunk and uncovered himself inside his tent. <em>22</em> Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father&#8217;s nakedness and told his two brothers who were outside. <em>23</em> Shem and Japheth took the garment and placed it on their shoulders. Then they walked in backwards and covered up their father&#8217;s nakedness. Their faces were turned the other way so they did not see their father&#8217;s nakedness.</p>

<p> 24 When Noah awoke from his drunken stupor he learned what his youngest son had done to him. 25 So he said,</p>

<p> &#8220;Cursed be Canaan!<br/>
 The <strong>lowest of slaves</strong><br/>
 he will be to his brothers.&#8221; <br/>
 26 He also said,</p>

<p> &#8220;Worthy of praise is the LORD, the God of Shem! <br/>
 May Canaan be the slave of Shem!<br/>
 27 May God enlarge Japheth&#8217;s territory and numbers!<br/>
 May he live in the tents of Shem <br/>
 and may Canaan be his slave!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>And so because Ham didn&#8217;t cover up his father&#8217;s nakedness, instead left his father&#8217;s tent to tell his brothers and laugh at his father (and possibly bring out Noah&#8217;s garment to show his brothers, before they honourably bring back &#8220;the garment&#8221;) all of Ham&#8217;s descendants are cursed to be the lowest of slaves (<strong>עֶבֶד עֲבָדִים eved avadim</strong>). The curse is pronounced on Canaan, not Ham.</p>

<p>While Genesis 9 only mentiones the Canaanites (Phoenecia/Palestine) as the people group under the curse of slavery from Ham, Genesis 10:6 also mentions the Cush (Nubia/Ethiopia), Mizraim (Egypt) and Put (Libya). Traditional Christian understanding asserts that Japheth went on to father the people group that became Western Europeans and Caucasians. Biblical literallists have used this understanding of Genesis for generations to support the idea that black people were under a curse from God to serve the white people as slaves. Unfortunately the idea humans come from Noah&#8217;s family <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/texas-public-school-course-teaches-racial-origins-traced-noah">still being taught by creationists in Texan public schools</a>.</p>

<p>Grant admits that the bible regulates slavery, but notes &#8220;it is true that the Bible also honestly records, and sometimes regulates, the practice of slavery. It is naïve in the extreme - just a poor reading strategy - to assume an endorsement&#8230; because it is regulated.&#8221; Of course, with modern apologetics, Grant can construct all kinds of fancy arguments about how &#8220;recording&#8221; and &#8220;regulating&#8221; slavery is not an endorsement, but that was never the way that <a href="http://www.lva.virginia.gov/lib-edu/education/psd/nation/halifax.htm">slave owners saw things in 1785</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>An Attempt carried on by the Enemies of our Country, Tools of the British Administration, and supported by a Number of deluded Men among us, to <strong>wrest from us our Slaves</strong> by an act of the Legislature for a general Emancipation of them&#8230; But is unsupported by the Word of God, and will be ruinous to Individuals and to the Public.</p>

<p>It is unsupported by the Word of God. Under the Old Testament Dispensation, Slavery was permitted by the Deity himself. Thus it is recorded, in Levit. Chap. 25. Ver. 44, 45, 46. &#8216;Both they Bond-men, and Bond-maids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the Heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy Bond-men and Bond-maids. Moreover, of the Children of the Strangers, that do sojourn among you of them shall ye buy, and of their Families that are with you, which they beget in your Land, and they shall be your Possession, and ye shall take them, as an Inheritance for your Children after you, to inherit them for a Possession; they shall be your Bond-men forever.&#8217; This <strong>Permission to possess and inherit Bond Servants</strong>, we have Reason to conclude, was continued through all the Revolutions of the Jewish Government, down to the Advent of our Lord. And we do not find, that either he or his Apostles abridged it. On the Contrary, the Freedom which the Followers of Jesus were taught to expect, was a Freedom from the Bondage of Sin and Satan, and from the Dominion of their Lusts and Passions; but as to their outward Condition, whatever that was, wether Bond or Free, when they embraced Christianity, it was to remain the same afterwards. This Saint Paul hath expressly told us 1 Cor. Chap. 7. Ver. 20th. where he is speaking directly to this very Point; &#8216;Let every Man abide in the same Calling, wherein he is called&#8217;; and at Ver. 24. &#8216;Let every Man wherein he is called therein abide with God.&#8217; Thus it is evident the above Attempt is unsupported by the Divine Word.</p></blockquote>

<p>Critically, Grant implies that there is such a clear difference between endoresment and regulation that it would be obvious to an informed reader which is which. In reality, proslavery apologists like James Henley Thornwell would simply present the <a href="http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/is-abolition-biblical">&#8220;plain reading&#8221; of scripture</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;On the eve of the Civil War, interpretations of the Bible that made the most sense to the broadest public were those that incorporated the defining experiences of America into the hermeneutics used for interpreting what the infallible text actually meant. In this effort, those who like James Henley Thornwell defended the legitimacy of slavery in the Bible had the easiest task. The procedure, which by 1860 had been repeated countless times, was uncomplicated. First, open the Scriptures and read, at say Leviticus 25:45, or, even better, at 1 Corinthians 7:20-21. Second, decide for yourself what these passages mean. Don’t wait for a bishop or a king or a president or a meddling Yankee to tell you what the passage means, but decide for yourself. Third, if anyone tries to convince  you that you are not interpreting such passages in the natural, commonsensical, ordinary meaning of the words, look hard at what such a one believes with respect to other biblical doctrines. If you find in what he or she says about such doctrines the least hint of unorthodoxy, as inevitably you will, then you may rest assured that you are being asked to give up not only the plain meaning of Scripture, but also the entire trust in the Bible that made the country into such a great Christian civilization.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>By defending what he claimed was the &#8220;plain&#8221; reading of scripture, Thornwell could then oppose supporters of abolitionism by accusing them of attacking Christianity. In a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Henley_Thornwell">speech, he stated</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The parties in this conflict are not merely abolitionists and slaveholders—they are atheists, socialists, communists, red republicans, jacobins, on one side, and the friends of order and regulated freedom on the other. In one word, the world is the battleground—Christianity and Atheism the combatants; and the progress of humanity at stake</p></blockquote>

<p>Grant states that &#8220;Any material regulating the practice of slavery needs to be read alongside the extensive material which shows the Bible ultimately opposes slavery.&#8221; By that maxim, any material that appears to offer exculpatory evidence must also be read alongside other material that refutes it. For instance, Grant claims that Yahweh&#8217;s freeing of the Israelite people from captivity proves that he doesn&#8217;t like slavery:</p>

<blockquote><p>It involves God&#8217;s rescue of his people out of slavery! Slavery is presented as unequivocally unpleasant and cruel. Refer Exodus 2:23-25:</p>

<p>During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God. God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob. So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them. (NIV84)</p></blockquote>

<p>What Grant conveniently ignores is that during the Exodus, the Israelite people had already been given the dominion over other races back in Genesis 17: 12-13, with Abraham owning Hagar, a slave girl from Egypt. The narrative has the Israelites escaping from Egypt and immediately being given permission to give passover to their own slaves, in Exodus 12: (ESV)</p>

<blockquote><p>43 And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the statute of the Passover: no foreigner shall eat of it, 44 but every slave that is bought for money may eat of it after you have circumcised him.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yahweh goes on in Exodus 20 to give clear commands</p>

<ul>
<li>You shall not murder.</li>
<li>You shall not commit adultery.</li>
<li>You shall not steal.</li>
<li>You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.</li>
</ul>


<p>But the final commandment is &#8220;You shall not covet your neighbor&#8217;s house. You shall not covet your neighbor&#8217;s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that belongs to your neighbor.&#8221; If god wanted to lay down a clear, unequivocal law against keeping slaves, he could easily do so like with murder, adultery, stealing and lying. Instead he categorises humans as property, like wives treated as chattel.</p>

<p>Grant claims that 1 Timothy 1 opposes the slave trade, but neglects to mention that the first slave ship to bring Africans to America was called &#8221;<a href="http://graceinafrica.com/the-good-ship-jesus/">The Good Ship Jesus</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote><p>A deeply religious gentleman, Hawkins insisted that his crew “serve God daily” and “love another” as he sailed his ship for Africa.  In a short time he had gathered up over 300 Africans “partly by sword and partly by other means.”  The other means included promising them free land and riches in the new world.</p></blockquote>

<p>If Yahweh wanted to give a clear prohibition he could do that.
Grant notes that Ephesians 6 &#8220;counter-culturally warns masters never to mistreat their slaves.&#8221; Of course, he fails to note that by a similar standard, 1 Corinthians 6:16-18 counter-culturally condemns prostitution clearly and unequivocally with no concession to the economic and cultural situation of the time, when to Corinthianise meant to fornicate.</p>

<p>Grant claims that &#8220;Paul encourages the emancipation of a runaway slave, Onesimus, in his letter to the wronged-master, Philemon.&#8221; He doesn&#8217;t note that the slave was sent back, and the note encouraged the slavemaster to seek dues from Paul. But Paul asserts the right for slavemasters to have their human propertyreturned, while he only argues for the emancipation of one slave, and the way in which future slavemasters would interpret how to deal with runaway slaves is left up to the circumstances.</p>

<p>Many other articles counter the idea that the <a href="http://www.skepticink.com/reasonablyfaithless/2013/02/07/slavery-bible-style/">bible is overwhelmingly against slavery</a>, or that Christians thoughout history have been <a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com.au/2010/07/slave-to-incompetence-truth-behind.html">overwhelmingly on the side of abolitionism</a>.</p>

<p>Justin Welby, on launching a campaign to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/07/05/homophobic-bullying-campaign-coe_n_3551701.html">stamp out anti-gay bullying in Anglican schools</a> noted &#8220;The majority of the population rightly detests homophobic behaviour or anything that looks like it and sometimes they look at us and see what they don&#8217;t like.&#8221; He followed up talking about his vote against marriage equality in the UK parliament, <a href="http://www.secularism.org.uk/blog/2013/08/on-homophobia-and-racism">noting</a></p>

<blockquote><p>We have seen changes in the idea about sexuality, sexual behaviour. We have to face the fact that the vast majority of people under 35 not only think that what we&#8217;re saying is incomprehensible but also think that we&#8217;re plain wrong and wicked and equate it to racism and other forms of gross and atrocious injustice. We have to be real about that.</p></blockquote>

<p>The question evangelicals now need to answer is, how would you like to be remembered by your kids? As someone who changed with the times, or someone who kept holding onto views that became increasingly despised?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>http://www.sineadoconnor.com/2013/10/open-letter-to-miley-cyrus/</p>

<p>http://amandapalmer.net/blog/20131003/</p>

<p>When Destiny Hope Cyrus rose to fame after being cast in Disney&#8217;s Hannah Montanna, many were enamoured with the country singer&#8217;s daughter from the buckle of the bible belt. To add to her family friendly charm, she described her Christian faith as &#8221;<a href="http://www.parade.com/celebrity/2010/03/miley-cyrus.html">very important</a>&#8221; and wrote about keeping the faith in <em>The Climb</em>. Some even saw her as part of a new movement of conservative Christian public figures that would bring the US <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130703010527/http://conservapedia.com/Essay:The_Coming_Fifth_Great_Awakening_in_America">back to social conservatism in a new great awakening</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/cyrus-c.png" alt="Conservapedia praises Cyrus's Christianity" /></p>

<p>Cyrus in 2007 described her stardom as being &#8221;<a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-01-10-miley-cyrus_x.htm">God&#8217;s will</a>&#8221;, promising that she wouldn&#8217;t start going crazy under the spotlight.</p>

<blockquote><p>In a pop culture filled with young hot starlets gone wild, isn&#8217;t Billy Ray worried that pretty Miley will soon start doing nutty Britney Spears-eque things, like not wearing underpants?</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s never wore underwear,&#8221; Billy Ray says without missing a beat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad!&#8221; Miley says.</p></blockquote>

<p>Miley went on to present an increasingly edgy image, with most media outlets <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/let-me-explain-why-miley-cyrus-vma-performance-was,33632/">disproportionately covering her antics instead of actual news</a>. This is the <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/Qy8xE">latest controvertial act</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/cyrus.gif" alt="Cyrus VMA performance" /></p>

<p>Why would she do such a thing? Probably because Professor Lawrence Krauss has addled her brain:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/krauss-craig.jpg" alt="William Lane Craig and Lawrence Krauss at Sydney Town Hall" />
Earlier this week William Lane Craig and Lawrence Krauss discussed cosmologogy and arguments for and against the existence of God. Professor Krauss concluded his opening remarks warning the audience against following the logic of syllogisms like this one:</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>All mammals exhibit homosexual behaviour</li>
<li>William Lane Craig is a mammal</li>
<li>Therefore, William Lane Craig exhibits homosexual behaviour</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Krauss briefly noted that the 2003 paper by Arvind Borde, Alan Guth, and Alexander Vilenkin (BGV hypothesis) that the universe has a beginning has issues.
Craig has previously tried to use the BGV hypothesis to suggest that the universe must have a beginning, and therefore a creator.
But as Vilenkin has pointed out <a href="https://debunkingwlc.wordpress.com/2010/07/14/borde-guth-vilenkin/">in his book</a> it would be &#8220;far too simplistic&#8221; to use his work to prove the existence of God (on the same page Dr Craig quotes from to support his argument). Further, Vilenkin mentioned in <a href="http://arizonaatheist.blogspot.com.au/2010/05/william-lane-craigs-arguments-for-god.html">an email</a> &#8220;the expansion of the universe must have had a beginning. You can evade the theorem by postulating that the universe was contracting prior to some time.&#8221; Craig has also relied on trying to say that because some collections cannot be infinite, <a href="http://www.skepticink.com/reasonablyfaithless/2013/03/25/infinity-minus-infinity/">no collections can be infinite, and past time cannot be infinite</a>.</p>

<p>Krauss went on to criticise the second premise of Craig&#8217;s version of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz&#8217;s cosmological argument, before Dr Craig went on to present it as &#8220;logically airtight.&#8221; The first premise is Leibniz&#8217;s Principle of Sufficient Reason, which is applied to the universe:</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>Anything that exists has an explanation of its existence, either in the necessity of its own nature or in an external cause</li>
<li>If the universe has an explanation of its existence, that explanation is God.</li>
<li>The universe exists.</li>
<li>Therefore, the universe has an explanation of its existence (from 1, 3)</li>
<li>Therefore, the explanation of the existence of the universe is God (from 2, 4).</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Craig also presents a <a href="http://mind.ucsd.edu/syllabi/02-03/01w/readings/taylor.pdf">Richard Taylor’s</a> illustration of a translucent ball, saying that if someone found a transluscent ball in nature they would probably seek an explanation for the ball&#8217;s exsistence rather than deciding it just exists inexplicably. He claims that the same should apply whether the ball is the size of a person, a car, a planet or a universe. But no matter the size of the ball, we still need evidence to <a href="http://www.maverick-atheism.org/2012/09/leibnizian-cosmological-argument-2.html">determine if the ball began to exist, or has an external cause</a>. And as Victor Stenger states &#8220;no cause is evident in the decay of a radioactive nucleus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Krauss went on to mention how many things in the universe seem to have an apparent design, but are formed randomly. For instance, geodesic domes seem to be designed, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminsterfullerene">Carbon-60 forms a structure that resembles a geodesic dome</a>. Similarly, life was once thought to be &#8220;fine tuned&#8221; by God on Earth, until we had evidence that self-replicating organic molecules can gain information by evolution though natural selection. And while the universe may appear to be designed for life, the fact that it is the only universe known to have life is not surprising as we&#8217;re in it.</p>

<p>Craig suggested that theology is &#8220;the queen of the sciences&#8221; despite having previously asserted that God is not subject to science. Krauss asked what new information theology had provided in the past 300 years (and mentioned that biology and physics can answer that question without arguing over the semantics of &#8216;knowledge&#8217;). The moderator moved on to another question. Krauss had previously mentioned that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz">Leibniz</a>, who died in 1716 had no awareness of Quantum Mechanics, so his views on cosmology were irrelevant.</p>

<p>I would argue that not only are Leibinz&#8217;s ideas irrelevant, they&#8217;ve already been dumped on by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire">Voltaire</a>. Leibniz believed that this world is the best of all possible worlds, and coined the word theodicy for his defence of a good God in a world that has much evil. His satirical novella <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candide">Candide</a> eloquently skewers the notion with the ideas of Dr Pangloss (&#8220;All Talk&#8221;):</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;It is demonstrable,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that things cannot be otherwise than as they are; for all being created for an end, all is necessarily for the best end. Observe, that the nose has been formed to bear spectacles—thus we have spectacles. Legs are visibly designed for stockings—and we have stockings. Stones were made to be hewn, and to construct castles—therefore my lord has a magnificent castle; for the greatest baron in the province ought to be the best lodged. Pigs were made to be eaten—therefore we eat pork all the year round. Consequently they who assert that all is well have said a foolish thing, they should have said all is for the best.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, this world of cause and effect exists for <em>sufficient reason</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>One day Cunegonde, while walking near the castle, in a little wood which they called a park, saw between the bushes, Dr. Pangloss giving a lesson in experimental natural philosophy to her mother&#8217;s chamber-maid, a little brown wench, very pretty and very docile. As Miss Cunegonde had a great disposition for the sciences, she breathlessly observed the repeated experiments of which she was a witness; she clearly perceived the force of the Doctor&#8217;s reasons, the effects, and the causes; she turned back greatly flurried, quite pensive, and filled with the desire to be learned; dreaming that she might well be a <strong>sufficient reason</strong> for young Candide, and he for her.</p>

<p>She met Candide on reaching the castle and blushed; Candide blushed also; she wished him good morrow in a faltering tone, and Candide spoke to her without knowing what he said. The next day after dinner, as they went from table, Cunegonde and Candide found themselves behind a screen; Cunegonde let fall her handkerchief, Candide picked it up, she took him innocently by the hand, the youth as innocently kissed the young lady&#8217;s hand with particular vivacity, sensibility, and grace; their lips met, their eyes sparkled, their knees trembled, their hands strayed. Baron Thunder-ten-Tronckh passed near the screen and beholding this <strong>cause and effect</strong> chased Candide from the castle with great kicks on the backside; Cunegonde fainted away; she was boxed on the ears by the Baroness, as soon as she came to herself; and all was consternation in this most magnificent and most agreeable of all possible castles.</p></blockquote>

<p>He goes on to satirically reflect on the theodicy of Leibniz&#8217;s free will defence:</p>

<blockquote><p>After the earthquake had destroyed three-fourths of Lisbon, the sages of that country could think of no means more effectual to prevent utter ruin than to give the people a beautiful auto-da-fé; for it had been decided by the University of Coimbra, that the burning of a few people alive by a slow fire, and with great ceremony, is an infallible secret to hinder the earth from quaking.</p>

<p>In consequence hereof, they had seized on a Biscayner, convicted of having married his godmother, and on two Portuguese, for rejecting the bacon which larded a chicken they were eating; after dinner, they came and secured Dr. Pangloss, and his disciple Candide, the one for speaking his mind, the other for having listened with an air of approbation. They were conducted to separate apartments, extremely cold, as they were never incommoded by the sun&#8230; They marched in procession thus habited and heard a very pathetic sermon, followed by fine church music. Candide was whipped in cadence while they were singing; the Biscayner, and the two men who had refused to eat bacon, were burnt; and Pangloss was hanged, though that was not the custom. The same day the earth sustained a most violent concussion.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lenny Bernstein&#8217;s oparetta is similarly brilliant. This is him conducting the opening overture:</p>

<p>Christians in the West have a habit of making all the depictions of biblical figures white. This is painfully evident in The Bible series on the History Channel. The series starts its Eurocentric presentation of Jewish scriptures with Adam and Eve as white supermodels:</p>

<p><img src="/images/adam-eve.jpg" alt="Adam and Eve as white supermodels" /></p>

<p>At least they figured out that &#8220;forbidden fruit&#8221; is a fig, long believed to be an aphrodisiac in the Middle East. The producers also cast Mohamen Mehdi Ouazanni as Satan, someone <a href="http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/television/barack-obama-lookalike-mohamen-mehdi-ouazanni-cast-as-satan-in-the-bible/story-e6frfmyi-1226600220510">many have commented has a resemblence to Barak Obama</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/satan-obama.jpg" alt="Barack Obama looks like Satan" /></p>

<p>While Jesus is shown as distinctively Causasian, Samson was cast as a black actor leading Reverend Wil Gafney to call the series <a href="http://www.wilgafney.com/2013/03/11/black-samson-white-women-on-the-history-channel">&#8220;a continuation of slave-holding racist exegesis.&#8221;</a> The December 2002 cover of Popular Mechanics featured a <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/forensics/1282186">reconstruction of the faces of males from around the time of Jesus</a>. The New Testament says that Jesus disappeared into crowds, and if Jesus looked like other men of the time this is what he would have looked like:</p>

<p><img src="/images/black-jesus-face.jpg" alt="Black Jesus by Popular Mechanics" /></p>

<p>The Irish producer Roma Downey chose to cast herself as Mary the mother of Jesus, and chose to give the role of Jesus of Nazareth to a similarly white skinned Portugese actor Diogo Morgado:</p>

<p><img src="/images/white-jesus.jpg" alt="White Jesus" /></p>

<p>If Jesus ever had hair this long, he&#8217;d probably get it stuck in his vice. Europeans love to show Jesus with long hair, despite Paul&#8217;s teaching in 1 Corinthians 11:14 clearly specifying &#8220;Does not nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace for him&#8221;. In fact, many contemporary scholars have noted that the Corinthian church existed at a time when male prostitutes had longer hair than other men to make them stand out as homosexuals. Despite this, modern evangelicals have remoulded Orthodox representations of Jesus into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_movement">New Age white hippie</a>.</p>

<p>But this isn&#8217;t the only way that Westerners present biblical stories specifically moulded to their target audience, against the grain of what the bible actually says. Western individualists love to read bible passages as written specifically for them, ignoring the original audience and context. For most of the history of Christianity, lay people did not read scriputre themselves, they had the bible read in a corporate context. It wasn&#8217;t until 1455 that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg_Bible">Johannes Gutenberg mass produced 180 bibles</a> and until 1561 that John Knox demanded universal education.</p>

<p>Now Americans complain that while most <a href="http://global.christianpost.com/news/dr-lamar-vest-on-why-owning-seven-bibles-is-not-enough-70608/">own four to seven bibles they hardly ever get time to read them</a>. Instead they&#8217;ll be encouraged to read the bible just <a href="http://au.christiantoday.com/article/Daily-Bible-reading-best-predictor-of-spiritual-growth/13987.htm">25 words at a time</a>. Not only are Westerners time-poor, they all too often seek a <a href="http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/bible-not-into-you">&#8220;reaffirmation of the individualistic, me-centered, and consumerist tendencies of American religious culture.&#8221;</a> Many megachurches are happy to give them a &#8220;seeker friendly&#8221; doctrine written by and for modern American individualists:</p>

<blockquote><p>Passages that were originally written for groups of people, and intended to be read and applied in a community setting (the nation of Israel, the various early churches, the first followers of Jesus), have been manipulated to communicate a personal, individual message&#8230;</p>

<p>We see this everywhere: in worship set lists that focus exclusively on individual worship, individual sin, and individual connection to God; in desk calendars that turn Jeremiah 29:11 (“For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord…”)  into a personal promise; in the disproportionate emphasis in our churches on personal Bible study, personal prayer, and one’s “personal walk with God.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Worse, publishers responding to people who like the sound of their own names will &#8220;personalize&#8221; the bible for them, massaging scripture into an ego stoking circlejerk. Isiah 53 no longer reads &#8220;he was pierced for <strong>our</strong> transgressions&#8221; but can be made to say &#8220;he was pierced for <strong>Rachel&#8217;s</strong> transgressions. He was crushed for <strong>Rachel&#8217;s</strong> iniquities.&#8221; The website lets you put in literally any name at all:</p>

<p><img src="/images/dahmer.jpg" alt="The bible according to Jeffrey Dahmer" /></p>

<h3>It ain&#8217;t in the bible, but it outta be</h3>

<p>This culture is happy to change the bible not only to suit the emotional desires of consumerists but also to make it suit contemporary social and political needs. Often Jesus is not presented as a redeemer saving individuals into a community, but is presented as a &#8220;package deal&#8221; that will provide for individual emotional and physical wants and needs, so long as they conform to the social and political aims of the church of the day.</p>

<p>Making the message &#8220;culturally relevant&#8221; can lead to presenting cultural idiosyncrasies along with religious doctrines until the two become confused. In one study, 10% of Americans thought that <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2007/0704.balmer.html">Noah&#8217;s wife was Joan of Arc, and two thirds thought Billy Graham preached the Sermon on the Mount</a>. The most popular &#8220;bible verse&#8221; in America the Benjamin Franklin quote is &#8220;God helps those who help themselves.&#8221; When challenged on the whether there is a any substantiation to claimed biblical backing of modern ideas, many Christians will fall back to the old line &#8220;well it ain&#8217;t in the bible, but it outta be&#8221;. Other common platitudes like &#8220;When God closes a door he opens a window&#8221; might give comfort to those struggling with flatulence, but are similarly unscriptural.</p>

<p>Unfortunately many Christians debate back and forward whether the <a href="http://www.myobamayear.com/2013/04/the-good-samaritan/">good Samaritan was a Democrat or a Republican</a>, missing the futitlity of massaging a 2000 year old religious parable into modern political doctrine. And yet this is exactly what politicians do, with to one of the best known quotes of Jesus saying &#8220;the poor you will always have among you&#8221; being frequently <a href="www.smh.com.au/opinion/bible-bashing-the-homeless-abbott-style-20100215-o2tj.html">used to oppose social justice initiatives on financial grounds</a> despite the fact the writers of the gospels place Jesus saying it in the house of <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt26.6-13;mark14.3-9&amp;version=NET">Simon the leper</a> or with <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jn12.1-8&amp;version=NET">Lazarus, who he raised from the dead</a>.</p>

<p>As bart ehrman states</p>

<blockquote><p>Most televangelists, popular Christian preacher icons, and heads of those corporations that we call megachurches share an unreflective modern view of Jesus – that he translates easily and almost automatically into a modern idiom. The fact is, however, that Jesus was not a person of the twenty-first century who spoke the language of contemporary Christian America (or England or Germany or anywhere else). Jesus was inescapably and ineluctably a Jew living in first-century Palestine. He was not like us, and if we make him like us we transform the historical Jesus into a creature that we have invented for ourselves and for our own purposes.</p>

<p>Jesus would not recognize himself in the preaching of most of his followers today. He knew nothing of our world. He was not a capitalist. He did not believe in free enterprise. He did not support the acquisition of wealth or the good things of life. He did not believe in massive education. He had never heard of democracy. He had nothing to do with going to church on Sunday. He knew nothing of social security, food stamps, welfare, American exceptionalism, unemployment numbers, or immigration. He had no views on tax reform, health care (apart from wanting to heal leprosy), or the welfare state. So far as we know, he expressed no opinion on the ethical issues that plague us today: abortion and reproductive rights, gay marriage, euthanasia, or bombing Iraq. His world was not ours, his concerns were not ours and – most striking of all – his beliefs were not ours.</p>

<p>Jesus was a first-century Jew, and when we try to make him into a twenty-first century American we distort everything he was and everything he stood for. Jesus himself was a complete supernaturalist. He believed in the Devil and demons and the forces of evil at work in this world. He knew little – possibly almost nothing – about the workings of the Roman Empire. But what little he knew, he considered evil. He may have considered all government evil unless it was a (future) theocracy to be run by God himself through his messiah. he certainly was no proponent of our political views, whatever our views happen to be….</p>

<p>The problem then with Jesus is that he cannot be removed from his time and transplanted into our own without simply creating him anew. When we create him anew we longer have the Jesus of history but the Jesus of our own imagination, a monstrous invention created to serve our own purposes. But Jesus is not so easily moved and changed. He is powerfully resistant. He remains always in his own time. As Jesus fads come and go, as new Jesuses come to take the place of the old, the real, historical Jesus continues to exist, back there in the past, the apocalyptic prophet who expected that a cataclysmic break would occur within his own generation when God would destroy the forces of evil, bring in his kingdom, and install Jesus himself on the throne. This is the historical Jesus. And he obviously far too historical for modern tastes. That is why so many Christians today try to reform him.</p>

<p>In my view, humanists, agnostics, atheists, mythicists, and anyone else who does not advocate belief in Jesus would be better served to stress that the Jesus of history is not the Jesus of modern Christianity than to insist – wrongly and counterproductively – that Jesus never existed. Jesus did exist. He simply was not the person that most believers today think he was.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many bible publishers are trying to contextualise the biblical ideas into american culture.

<h3>God as husband</h3>

<p>Ultimately many Christians don&#8217;t base their views of their god on the bible, viewing the bible through the lens of the culture they&#8217;re in, which is why their god&#8217;s actions and character reflect their own personal desires and perferences. When one&#8217;s understanding of the Christian God is grounded in pre-existing cultural and social assumptions, statements like this make sense:</p>

<p><img src="/images/god-husband.jpg" alt="God as husband" /></p>

<p>This &#8220;deal&#8221; is not the gospel of Christianity, it&#8217;s a <a href="http://ajoyfulvapour.tumblr.com/post/45499852946/this-is-a-load-of-crap-where-is-its-scriptual">load of crap, and a lie, and a load of bollocks</a>. If they don&#8217;t get these stupid ideas from the bible, where do they get them from? There is a widespread cultural assumption that &#8220;everyone knows&#8221; that god wants people to marry &#8220;the one&#8221; for them. Many Christians are happy to play into cultural anxieties about love, sex and singleness to present marriage as part of the &#8220;package deal&#8221; of Christianity. Dagmar Herzog describes the American religious right as pushing a regressive social agenda by painting a rosy picture of marriage, and building on the insecurities of sexual inexperience in youth:</p>

Author Dagmar Herzog examines the efforts of religious conservatives to influence sexual culture in the U.S. during the Bush Administration. Herzog claims widespread increases in religion-themed sex education, therapy, and medical research as examples.

&#8212;&#8211;

Has the conservative agenda come to dominate the national and international conversation on sexual rights?

Obama&#8217;s victory and the vote against abortion bans in Colorado and South Dakota brought some sexual rights back from the edge of a political precipice, but others remain in the balance.

Join scholars, journalists, and policy makers to talk about how we can help the new administration change policies and reframe national and international thinking on sexual rights.

Participants include Dagmar Herzog, author of Sex in Crisis: The New Sexual Revolution and the Future of American Politics and Professor of History, Lynn Paltrow, Executive Director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women, Nation columnist Katha Pollitt, and Faye Wattleton, Director of the Center for the Advancement of Women.

Discussant: Rosalind Petchesky, author of Sexuality, Health and Human Rights and Distinguished Professor of Political Science. Moderated by Michelle Fine, Distinguished Professor of Psychology at the Graduate Center, CUNY - City University of New York

Dagmar Herzog is a Professor of History at the Graduate Center, CUNY, where she focuses on modern European history, the history of sexuality, and the history of the religion.

<p>The Materialistic Western culture is built on functional saviours. Shampoo is sold to people by telling them that unclean hair makes them undesirable, then promising to make them beautiful if they buy more product. Targetting this culture with &#8220;seeker friendly&#8221; material often means presenting a relationship Jesus as a functional saviour, a means to an end for the individual, rather than an end in and of itself. &#8220;The most important relationship you can have &#8211; one that will make you a better husband and father &#8211; is a relationship with God&#8221; reads an altar call in one <a href="http://www.everystudent.com/features/wolves.html">mendacious promise of long lasting and happy marriages</a>. Another promises &#8221;<a href="http://www.everystudent.com/features/marriage.html">hope for a lasting marriage</a>&#8221; if only one accepts Jesus. Others offer Jesus as a way for <a href="http://www.everystudent.com/wires/toxic.html">men</a> and <a href="http://www.everystudent.com/wires/jenniferm.html">women</a> to stop looking at porn. People accepting these altar calls and praying their sinner&#8217;s prayers will never know what they&#8217;ve accepted unless they read the bible to understand what is actually in it, and what &#8220;outta be&#8221;.</p>

<h3>Myths and misinformation pushing shame and intimidation</h3>

<p>The relationships altar call comes after two and a half A4 pages of bullshit about how &#8220;Waiting to have sex with my wife will mean better sex in my marriage.&#8221; It launches into all the standard canards Christians have been told to believe &#8220;the more I bond with other girls, the less I&#8217;ll be able to bond with my future wife. It&#8217;s like a piece of scotch tape &#8211; the more you use it on different surfaces, the less it sticks to things.&#8221; When entire mission strategies are built around ignorance on sex and relationships, Christians will do anything in their power to promote misinformation. Because they are offering Chrsitianity as a solution to problems of their own making.</p>

<p>Abstinance only sex education programs reinforce ignorance in 30% of United States public schools. They <a href="http://www.siecus.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.ViewPage&amp;PageID=1199">teach canards like</a> “Condoms can never protect someone from the emotional problems that can result from multiple sexual partners and premature sexual activity.” And “AIDS can be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact.” They discourage the responsible use of barrier methods like condoms, teaching that “The only safe sex is in a marriage relationship where a man and a woman are faithful to each other for life.”</p>

<p>These programs not only promote the idea that premarital sex has risks, but demonises it as permanantly scarring. “If [a girl] has been involved in sexual activity…sexually, she is no longer a virgin, she is no longer pure, unspoiled, fresh&#8221; they teach. They warn that “The consequences of pre-marital sex include “guilt, disappointment, worry, depression, sadness, loneliness, and loss of self-esteem.” They warn 6th grade children &#8220;Going on this ride could change your life forever, result in poverty, heartache, disease, and even DEATH.” It goes on to say that many “will board this ride and come out losers.” The manual goads “did you know that sexual activity outside of the commitment of marriage could put YOUR FUTURE at risk?”</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t believe that they teach children that they&#8217;ll die, watch this:</p>

<p>These teachings encourage a culture of shame and permanent condemnation. In a survey, when researchers dropped a live cockroach into orange juice, then removed the cockroach and sterilised the juice, <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com.au/2013/02/the-psychology-of-christian-purity.html">the majority of participants wouldn&#8217;t drink it</a>. Paul Rozin, author of the study also found that <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-10-27/entertainment/0510260352_1_disgusting-paul-rozin-important-part">40% of participants would refuse to eat poo-shaped chocolate, or drink juice from a brand-new bedpan</a>. Even when people know that disgusting looking food is safe to eat, emotionally, many refuse. While many sins that the bible speaks against are presented as mistakes, conservative evangelicals always talk about sexual integrity in terms of purity. They encourage the view that anyone who isn&#8217;t a virgin is permanantly broken, corrupted, contaminated and that they cannot make themselves clean again.</p>

<h3>The overreach and failure of the purity doctrine</h3>

<p>Demonising pre-marital sex as permanantly scarring and unforgivable has created a culture in which people are afraid even to date. &#8220;There is no condom for the human heart&#8221; teach the fear mongers. They preach not only that virginity is the most important gift a girl can give her husband, but that they should be &#8220;emotional virgins&#8221; and not <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2011/09/love-virginity.html">&#8220;give away pieces of their heart.&#8221;</a> This is bullshit. And yet, it has almost lured a <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2012/10/what-i-learned-from-joshua-harris.html">whole generation out of dating until they are sure they can marry</a>. This hooks into the intuition that &#8220;everyone knows&#8221; that God will provide them with &#8220;the one&#8221;, which &#8220;outta be&#8221; in the bible there somewhere. Single Christian women who spend the last decade in the purity culture suddenly find themselves <a href="http://sydneyanglicans.net/life/daytoday/single_christian_female_30">ostracised and isolated as church ministries direct all their 30+ ministries to families</a>.</p>

<p>Many women have given up on wearing purity rings. For some, it&#8217;s because they <a href="http://gracefortheroad.com/2012/02/03/idontwait/">feel complete in their relationship with Jesus, and aren&#8217;t &#8220;waiting&#8221; anymore</a></p>

<blockquote><p>There are a lot of girls out there who don’t know who God is anymore – the God of their youth group years just isn’t working out. Back then, that God said to wait for sex until they are married, until He brings the right man along for a husband. They signed a card and put it on the altar and pledged to wait&#8230;</p>

<p>Some of them have prayed their whole lives for a husband, and he hasn’t shown up. They’ve heard the advice to “be the woman God made you to be, focus on that, and then the husband will come.” They’ve read “Lady in Waiting,” gotten super involved in church and honed their domestic skills.</p>

<p>More than a decade ago, a youth leader handed them a photocopied poem in Sunday School written to them from “God” that said, “The reason you don’t have anyone yet is because you’re not fully satisfied in Me. You have to be satisfied with Me and then when you least expect it, I’ll bring you the person I meant for you.”</p>

<p>&#8230;Many of them – if they’re honest – will tell you that time has passed, and it’s wrecking their view of God.</p></blockquote>

<p>Others have given up on the culture of bullying and intimidation that <a href="http://sexetc.org/info-center/post/why-i-stopped-wearing-a-purity-ring/">accompanies the purity culture</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Originally, when I made the commitment to wait until marriage, I really only saw my ring as a symbol of how personally valuable my virginity was to me. However, after I saw how readily my peers bullied and mocked girls who they thought were sexually active, my ring seemed like more of a constant reminder of how dirty and useless people might think I was if I wasn’t a virgin anymore.</p></blockquote>

<p>For some, it&#8217;s the knowledge that <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1802108/">95% of Americans have sex before marriage</a>, or that <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2768056/">Five years after taking a virginity pledge, 82% of pledgers denied having ever pledged</a>. Others note that even in Southern Baptist churches <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3156853/">70% of engaged Christians quietly have sex before marrying</a>. Many women who hit this inevitable conclusion are finding the courage to speak out about the <a href="http://www.prodigalmagazine.com/the-day-i-turned-in-my-v-card/">deep and long lasting damage of the purity culture</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p> I broke a barrier and gave up an idea I’d held onto as a “Good Christian Girl” for a long, long time. If you grew up in American Christian culture, you know that a statement like mine is one of the most life changing, socially desolating, parentally disappointing pronouncements you can make. Especially if you’re a girl.</p>

<p> But I don’t care anymore; I’m done with virginity.</p>

<p> I’m done with that word and that idea. I’m done defining myself, my past and my future, in terms of who’s what has been where, or hasn’t. I’m done with stories for virgins and non-virgins, promises and praises, and sentiments of “restoration” that just push forward bulldozer loads of this horrible twisted shame.</p></blockquote>

<p>Others are speaking out for those who have <a href="http://deeperstory.com/i-am-damaged-goods/">been damaged by the notion that their sexual past is keeping them back from being a Christian</a></p>

<blockquote><p> I was nineteen years old and crazy in love with Jesus when that preacher told an auditorium I was “damaged goods” because of my sexual past. He was making every effort to encourage this crowd of young adults to “stay pure for marriage.” He was passionate, yes, well-intentioned, and he was a good speaker, very convincing indeed.</p>

<p> And he stood up there and shamed me, over and over and over again.</p>

<p> Oh, he didn’t call me up to the front and name me. But he stood up there and talked about me with such disgust, like I couldn’t be in that real-life crowd of young people worshipping in that church. I felt spotlighted and singled out amongst the holy, surely my red face announced my guilt to every one&#8230;</p>

<p> And so here, now, I’ll stand up and say it, the way I wish someone had said it to me fifteen years ago when I was sitting in that packed auditorium with my heart racing, wrists aching, eyes stinging, drowning and silenced by the imposition of shame masquerading as ashes of repentance:</p>

<p> “So, you had sex before you were married.</p>

<p> It’s okay.</p>

<p> Really. It’s okay.</p>

<p> There is no shame in Christ’s love. Let him without sin cast the first stone. You are more than your virginity – or lack thereof – and more than your sexual past.</p></blockquote>

<p>Others who kept their virginity are also <a href="http://www.elizabethesther.com/2013/01/virginity-new-improved.html">pushing back on the purity culture that teaches that non-sexual relationships are as dangerous as sexual ones</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p> Yes, I was a virgin on my wedding day. Then again, I was only 20. Yes, remaining a virgin until my wedding day saved me from some romantic heartbreak. Then again, I’ve had other heartbreaks. Yes, chastity is special. Then again, so are lots of virtues. Except, as a 20 year old bride, I thought virginity was extra-extra special and would win me lots of special prizes like: a happily ever after marriage.</p>

<p> It took me a long time to realize I idolized virginity. I kept saying I was just promoting virtue and chastity and purity! Nothing wrong with pushing purity, right? Nothing wrong with Being Good!</p>

<p> Like other Christians, I talked about the “sacrifice” of abstinence. There were princess-themed books about saving our first kiss. Some of us wore purity rings and made pledges to our Daddies not to have sex until we’re married.</p>

<p> Ultimately, we implied that <strong>a woman’s inherent worth and dignity could be measured by whether or not a man has touched her</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>As women who spend their young adult years believing that pre-marital sex is &#8220;not all it&#8217;s cracked up to be&#8221; start hitting struggles in their own &#8220;perfect&#8221; marriages, the church is happy to offer a whole industry of Christian sex advice.</p>

<h3>Race to the bottom</h3>

<p>This gospel offers &#8220;perfect&#8221; sex in a &#8220;perfect&#8221; marriage so long as one accepts the &#8220;package deal&#8221; of White Jesus with the cultural vestments of looking, sounding and voting Christian.</p>

He knew nothing of social security, food stamps, welfare, American exceptionalism, unemployment numbers, or immigration. He had no views on tax reform, health care (apart from wanting to heal leprosy), or the welfare state. So far as we know, he expressed no opinion on the ethical issues that plague us today: abortion and reproductive rights, gay marriage, euthanasia, or bombing Iraq.
