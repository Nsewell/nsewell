<p>Steven Pinker in an <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/why-are-states-so-red-and-blue/">opinion piece</a> suggested that the reason America is so polically and socially diverse. He argues that Blue states were largely settled by English farmers, while Red states by Scots-Irish herders.</p>

<blockquote><p>Societies that herd livestock in rugged terrain tend to develop a “culture of honor.” Since their wealth has feet and can be stolen in an eye blink, they are forced to deter rustlers by cultivating a hair-trigger for violent retaliation against any trespass or insult that probes their resolve. Farmers can afford to be less belligerent because it is harder to steal their land out from under them, particularly in territories within the reach of law enforcement&#8230; Southerners today continue to manifest a culture of honor which legitimizes violent retaliation</p></blockquote>

<p>Pinker notes that under traditional, rugged societies violent and aggressive men were meant to be civilised by a churchgoing woman.</p>

<blockquote><p>Another cliché of the cowboy movies also had an element of historical truth. As more women moved west, they worked to end the lifestyle of brawling, boozing and whoring they found there, joining forces with the officials in charge of the rowdy settlements. They found a natural ally in the church, with its co-ed membership, norms of temperance and Sunday morning discipline.  By the time the government consolidated its control over the West&#8230; the norms of self-defense through masculine honor, and the restraint of ruffianism by women and church, had taken root.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many Southern Baptists continue with a frontier tradition of distrusting and resenting government (especially federal) laws that restrict personal freedoms, they readily believe that arbitrary and pointless church rules are good for them. It&#8217;s this type of political climate that breeds <a href="/blog/2013/01/03/rentier-theology/">strange bedfellows, with the Religious Right co-opting both religion and politics</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>According to a new study, reported in The Age, <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/health/worry-grows-over-safety-of-childhood-jabs-20130519-2juvt.html">53% of Australian parents have concerns about vaccinating their children</a>.</p>

<p>The NSW opposition is considering allowing childcare centres <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-19/push-to-ban-unvaccinated-children-from-nsw-preschools/4698786">ban unvaccinated individuals</a>. The opposition states that immunisation rates are lower than in Rwanda and Iran. Looking the stats up, it&#8217;s true. <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.IMM.MEAS/countries">WHO data on measels immunisation</a> show that 94% of Australian children are immunised, compared to 99% in Iran and 95% in Rwanda. <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.IMM.IDPT/countries">WHO data on Diptheria, Pertussis and Tetanus immunisation</a> shows 92% of Australian children are immunised, compared to 99% in Iran and 97% in Rwanda.</p>

<p>There were <a href="http://www0.health.nsw.gov.au/data/diseases/measles.asp">172 cases of measles in NSW in 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.wahs.nsw.gov.au/news/2012/20121004_00.html">requiring the opening of new health centres to distribute the Mesles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine</a> Data from Medicare show that NSW and WA have <a href="http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/provider/patients/acir/statistics.jsp">the lowest immunisation rates</a> with 89.3% of WA children 60-63 months of age.</p>

<p>There are communities with less than <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-04-11/children-across-australia-not-fully-imunised/4622666">85% of children vaccinated, with 77,000 not fully immunised nationally</a>. Pockets in <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-03-20/anti-vaccination-campaigns-threaten-measles-free-status/4584514">northern NSW and southern QLD are at greatest risk</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Dr MacIntyre says some parts of Australia have a greater risk of a measles outbreak because of lower immunisation rates, such as northern New South Wales and southern Queensland.</p>

<p>Australian Medical Association (AMA) president Steve Hambleton says it is those areas which threaten Australia&#8217;s position.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our [measles] elimination status is under threat because there are pockets of decreasing immunisation of our children,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some affluent areas in Sydney also have <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-04-11/low-immunisation-rates-in-affluent-sydney/4622634">lower immunisation rates</a>
Unfortunately the role of fear campaigns like Meryl Dorey&#8217;s Australian Vaccination Network have scared a large number of parents into fearing vaccines. My opinion is that the AMA should be more proactive in online media, taking out ads on search results for searches like &#8216;vaccination&#8217; to make sure that correct information comes up before AVN&#8217;s fearmongering.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier this month shocking news broke that <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-07/women-missing-for-years-found-alive-in-house/4674150">three women who had been adbucted and imprisoned for nine to twelve whole years had escaped</a>. Michelle Knight was kidnapped in 2002 aged 20, Gina DeJesus was 14 when she was kidnapped. Some of the women had childen by their captor, and Michelle Knight reportedly was forced to deliver them in unsanitary conditions, without any training. The women were rescued when a neighbor, who happened to have the day off, heard one of their screams and kicked down part of the door.</p>

<div class="youtube-lazy-link-info">Charles Ramsey interview, rescuer of Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight in Cleveland</div>
</a>
<div class="video-info" >CLEVELAND - After going missing more than 10 years ago, Amanda Berry shouted to a man from a Seymour Avenue house on Monday.
Charles Ramsey and Angel Cordero broke down the door and freed Berry, who was 16 when she disappeared in 2003. Cordero told NewsChannel5&#8217;s Stephanie Ramirez that he recognized Berry from posters and that she was with a 4 or 5-year-old child.

Other victims Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus.

</div>


<p>The neighbor, Charles Ramsey, had lived next door for a full year and ate together with the captor, with no idea what was happening inside the home. While the media says that he&#8217;s a hero, he insists that anyone else would have done the same thing in the circumstances. What has haunted him, however, was the knowledge that he could have intervened much earlier had he known.</p>

<p>One of the girls, Amanda Berry, had her face all over the news when she was kidnapped in 2003. Berry&#8217;s mother refused to give up hope of finding her daughter alive for 19 months, until she turned to a &#8220;psychic&#8221; who told her &#8221;<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/05/amanda_berry_is_dead_psychic_t.html">She’s not alive, honey</a>.&#8221; The poor woman died in 2006, never knowing that her daughter was alive.</p>

<p>On learning of her niece&#8217;s freedom, Georgina DeJesus&#8217;s aunt proclaimed that the rescue was a miracle, and &#8221;<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2013/05/08/cleveland-women-were-chained.html">God works in mysterious ways</a>&#8221;. One of the more disturbing revelations is that the rapist <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/may/08/cleveland-ariel-castro-child-abduction">was a school bus driver investigated by police in 2004 for abduction and endangering children</a> after he kept a boy on his school bus for two hours. Police officers turned up to the abductor&#8217;s home months before he kidnapped DeJesus, but left after nobody answered their knocks on the door. This is much like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping_of_Jaycee_Lee_Dugard#Missed_opportunities_to_rescue_Dugard">Jaycee Lee Dugard</a> case, where three years before the abducted girl was rescued, a neighbor informed the police there were tents in the abductor&#8217;s backyard with children living in them. Police talked with the abductor for 30 minutes on the property, but never searched it. After Dugard&#8217;s rescue, she was awarded a settlement of $20 million dollars from the Californian government for their mishandling of the case. Many people talk about the rescue of the girls being a miracle, and yet in both cases we see god failing to nudge the police in the right direction years before.</p>

<p>Consider this scenario: if you found a neighbor begging and pleading to escape the house, whould you intervene by kicking down the door straight away? Or if you would wait to let the captor free the girls of his own accord, how long would you wait for? Now consider: if you were God, would you intervene straight away if you heard a captive&#8217;s pleas? Would you choose to violate the captor&#8217;s free will in order to protect the women? If you would intervene straight away, why didn&#8217;t God intervene for Michelle Knight for over 12 years?</p>

<p>William Lane Craig defines God <a href="http://www.skepticink.com/reasonablyfaithless/2013/01/01/arguing-about-ontology/">in this way</a>: “God is, by definition, the greatest being conceivable.” Can you conceive of a God that doesn&#8217;t take 12 years to hear the cry of an abducted girl? Then it would seem that you can conceive of a greater being than the one Dr Craig believes in.</p>

<p>To me, the God of the Old Testament seems like a capricious and vindictive sort of character. Can you imagine a god that doesn&#8217;t endorse <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deut21.10-14&amp;version=NET">sex slavery for widows</a> or the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=num31&amp;version=NET">enslavement of 32,000 virgins for the enjoyment of Israelite soldiers as part of their &#8220;booty&#8221;</a>? What about a god that doesn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/may/30/christian-fundamentalists-plan-teach-genocide">order the slaughter of Amalekite men, women and children</a> (often taught as a <a href="https://intrinsicdignity.wordpress.com/2010/04/19/good-news-club-on-the-slaughter-of-the-amalekites/">lesson in <em>complete</em> obedience</a>)? If you can imagine a deity without any of these bloodthirsty traits then by Dr Craig&#8217;s logic you&#8217;ve disproven the Old Testament god is the one true God.</p>

<p>What if you don&#8217;t like Paul&#8217;s views on <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1pet2.18;tit2.9;eph6.5-8&amp;version=NET">slaves</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph5.22-24&amp;version=NET">women</a> or <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1ti1.8-10;1cor6.9-10;rom1.18-32&amp;version=NET">gays</a>? Simple, just start your own faith tradition to worship your own interpretation of the Christian god. There are between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian#Demographics">38,000</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_denominations">41,000 Christian denominations</a> in the world, more than the <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=number%20of%20sentences%20in%20the%20bible">33,829 sentences in the KJV</a>. Some of these denominations are the same movement in different countries, but the figures show Christians have a wide diversity of opinion not just on liturgy but on core beliefs like the inspiration of scripture, the divinity of Jesus, the existence of hell, the role (if any) of baptism and any methods of salvation.</p>

<p>Protestants maintain that the only thing necessary for belief is scripture alone (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_scriptura">Sola Scriptura</a>).
If Protestantism is true, and a key part of Protestant Christian experience is reading the bible, why
did it take so long to invent a printing press? Why didn&#8217;t Yahweh pop one in at the first council of Nicea in 325 CE when they established biblical cannon?</p>

<p>If Jesus was the incarnation of the Logos of a triune godhead, did he have omniscience to see the future? Could he see that <a href="http://www.errancywiki.com/index.php?title=Legends2">5 different endings to Mark would be added by five different scribes</a>? Why didn&#8217;t he give his disciples an approved, inerrant version of his teachings? If salvation from an eternal torment in conscious pain requires the accurate transmission of scripture, why didn&#8217;t God ensure that the scripture could be accurately copied and transmitted from the very start of the early Church? Couldn&#8217;t that have minimised the number of differences of opinion between denominations?</p>

<p>Even in an age when most Chrisitans do have 4-7 bibles in their home, most don&#8217;t read them. In one study, 12% of Americans thought that <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2007/0704.balmer.html">Noah&#8217;s wife was Joan of Arc, and two thirds thought Billy Graham preached the Sermon on the Mount</a>. Most people&#8217;s favourite &#8220;bible verse&#8221; was &#8220;God helps those who help themselves.&#8221; Ironically, in a time of rising illiteracy, we also see conservatives demanding belief in <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/exploringourmatrix/2012/06/ken-ham-wants-other-christians-to-be-con-artists-like-he-is.html">young earth creationism</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention_conservative_resurgence">inerrancy</a> of scripture (not infallability), bordering on &#8221;<a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/2012/03/guest-post-the-culture-of-biblical-inerrantism/">biblicalism</a>&#8221;.</p>

<p>If Jesus had omniscience, could he fortell of the <a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/god-science-and-black-death-plague.html">millions that would die in the Black Plague</a>? Could he fortell that it would take the scientific method centuries after the plague to understand how to stop the spread of disease? He decided to let people know that hell burns eternally at <a href="http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/hell.htm">the boiling point of Sulfur, 444.6 degrees Celcius</a>, but did he tell people how long to boil water for to sterilise surgical tools?</p>

<p>When Republican Senate candidate Richard Mourdock said pregnancy resulting from rape is something “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl9e-f6nbd4">God intended to happen</a>,” it lead many to ask the question; does that mean the rape is something God intended to happen? Medicine has established the germ theory of disease (still denied by Mary Bakker Eddy&#8217;s Christian Science cult) only from studying dead bodies. If it&#8217;s God&#8217;s will that modern medicine be able to treat sick people so that our Western life expectancies are many times what they were in the dark ages, did God preordain doctors to treat people? And if they needed cadavres to research, did God preordain that the knowledge would be gained from deaths?  If God has given us knowledge and the ability to use logic, why not give us the brains to innovate faster and prevent unnecessary deaths?</p>

<p>Consider how bad medical knowledge was throughout the dark ages. Carl Sagan writes in The Demon Haunted World:</p>

<blockquote><p>Pre-modern medical practice did not save many. Queen
Anne was the last Stuart monarch of Great Britain. In the last seventeen
years of the seventeenth century, she was pregnant eighteen times. Only five
children were born alive. Only one of them survived infancy. He died before
reaching adulthood, and before her coronation in 1702. There seems to be no
evidence of some genetic disorder. She had the best medical care money
could buy.</p></blockquote>

<p>If God could have providentially sent scientists at any point in human history, why wait over a millennium to give humans the germ theory of disease? Why wait until after Queen Anne&#8217;s demise to give humans knowledge of Obstetrics and Gynecology?</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t find myself able to believe that there is any God capable of influencing the world today. It seems more likely that humans have picked themselves up by their bootstraps, and while religion continues to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPDlgq-znrY&amp;list=PL9zmXhEAnxT9hXW_2NJ7ZvdbiMuwSN5Ll&amp;index=6">perpetuate violence and hostility in the third world</a> the West is <a href="http://thegatesnotes.com/Books/Personal/The-Better-Angels-of-Our-Nature">experiencing a period of unprecedented peace and prosperity</a>. In fact, it seems that for most of human history people have been <a href="http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/199704--.htm">expanding their circle of empathy</a> from themselves to their families, their churches, their nations and to collections of nations. The future of humanity will be brighter if we can expand this circle to all humans and even other animals and the environment:</p>

<p>I believe that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFDJJ1KydgE">promoting human flourishing and the minimisation of suffering rather than any ideology</a> will have the biggest positive impact on humankind. In fact, the pursuit of ideologies can often get in the way of human good. Consider the case of a 22-year-old Salvadoran woman with Lupus having to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/el-salvador-must-provide-pregnant-woman-access-life-saving-medical-treatment-2013-04-17">seek approval to abort her brainless foetus from the Salvadoran Supreme Court</a>, after all abortions were banned in 1998. Despite the fact that the foetus will never be conscious, or able to feel pain, Catholic Bishops are campaigning not to let the woman terminate the pregnancy that threatens her life. In my opinion, this is the dangerous product of basing decisions on ideology, not facts.</p>

<p>As a humanist, I believe that the promotion of human welfare should trump ideology, and this is enough to have a worthwhile purpose in life. Robert Green Ingersoll <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Robert_G._Ingersoll">stated it like this</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Reason, observation and experience have taught us that happiness is the only good; that the time to be happy is now, the place to be happy is here and the way to be happy is to make others so. This is enough for us. In this belief we are content to live and die.</p></blockquote>

<p>Already as I write this some people will be asking where they went wrong. Was it that they didn&#8217;t share enough <a href="http://www.ship-of-fools.com/gadgets/food_drink/015.html">testamints</a> or didn&#8217;t buy me the <a href="http://wp.patheos.com/blogs/unreasonablefaith/files/2009/07/armor-of-god-pjs.jpg">Full Armor of God Pyjamas</a> or was it that I acquired critical thinking skills and wrestled with these and other questions? Probably the pyjamas. Of course, Chrsitianity has taught me many <a href="http://christiannymphos.org/2009/07/09/cunnilingus-101/">useful things</a> and I still enjoy reading Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes.</p>

<p>Some fundamentalist churches teach to love your neighbour, but hate Hindus, Buddhists, atheists, Muslims, gays, Jews, blacks and anyone suspected of being a feminist. This might make sense in a small street in a leafy suburb, but does it work if you live in an apartment? What happens when your digital neighbours are not just the 10 people you know on your street but the 600 people you know on social media? You&#8217;re going to hear the attitude and opinions of people with differing political, religious and ideological views. Don&#8217;t do this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/unicorn-shun.jpg" alt="Shuun the non-believer!" /></p>

<p>I am happy to publicly state my opinion and I believe that everybody who wants to should be able to question every belief that I hold, attack every doctrine that I maintain and answer every question that I pose. But there&#8217;s a time and a place for this. Until then, why not just be friends?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The religious right has been using sex to sell a represive anti-sex agenda, creating the idea of soulgasms, where if Jesus is in the room, couples will have the most amazing orgasms ever, so long as they are married.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We must fight [lust] with the massive promise of superior happiness. We must swallow up the little flicker of lust’s pleasure in the conflagration of holy satisfaction.” John Piper</p></blockquote>

<p>Many Christians today don&#8217;t present Jesus as a redeemer for all people and all cultures that saves individuals into a community that will have a transformative influence on their life. Instead they present a moralising gospel of American Jesus as the functional saviour that will give someone friends, social status in the Christian subculture, and perfect sex in a perfect marriage so long as they look and sound Christian enough. Rather than empowering countercultural belief in liberation theology of Jesus&#8217;s teachings, it imposes a literalistic rule based adherance to a culture of shame, fear and intimidation of Christendom. It&#8217;s against this context that mission strategies are devised to present Christianity as the solution to singleness, rejection and loneliness.</p>

<p>This has many damaging effects on young people inculcated into the culture. It tells young adults that virginity matters more than chastity, and even if they spend 60 hours a week volunteering for charity, they have no standing in the church if they have ever had sex. It forces young women into the position of having no sexual agency, no ability to consent to sex, but all of the responsibility for &#8220;causing&#8221; lust in men.</p>

<p>Barna has polled the reasons why young adults leave the church (and many leave the faith altogether). Their <a href="http://www.barna.org/teens-next-gen-articles/528-six-reasons-young-christians-leave-church">results show six key categories for why people leave</a>, facts that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karl-giberson-phd/creationists-and-young-christians_b_1096839.html">cause consternation for some</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Churches seem overprotective.</li>
<li>Teens and 20-somethings&#8217; experience of Christianity is shallow.</li>
<li>Churches come across as antagonistic to science.</li>
<li><strong>Young Christians&#8217; church experiences related to sexuality are often simplistic, judgmental.</strong></li>
<li>They wrestle with the exclusive nature of Christianity.</li>
<li>The church feels unfriendly to those who doubt.</li>
</ol>


<p>Presenting sex inside marriage as always perfect, always effortless and always satisfying as it is in accordance with God&#8217;s design&#8221; sets young couples up for a steep learning curve. Those who can&#8217;t wait, like 70% of conservative Texan Southern Baptist couples will feel secret shame that they may not even be able to bring before a pastor if they have overstated the significance of sex in relation to other sin.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a stranger niche of homeschooled daughters going to purity balls, to leart to save their first kiss until their wedding day. Having taken the simplistic black and white answers around sex, they are now pushing out a legalistic agenda to beyond what the bible even remotely supports.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s starting to be pushback.</p>

<h3>DRISCOLL</h3>

<p>Christians starting to warm up to plain talk about sexual issues for married couples.</p>

<p>But pastors aren&#8217;t sex therapists - and you can&#8217;t always get simplistic answers to every question. The desire to have a minister explain &#8216;this is ok, this is not ok&#8217; is rooted in not wanting to understand the hermeneutic view of scripture</p>

<h3>Damage</h3>

<p>Pushing damage onto women

<p>Ezekiel 23</p>

<p>Ignorance of the size and extent of the purity culture leaves people unable to understand its real effects. Shaming female sexuality can cause <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2011/11/the-purity-culture-and-sexual-dysfunction.html">serious sexual dysfunction well into marriage</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>After a few months, I did start having sexual fantasies. But they were all fantasies of non-consensual sex. Why? Because on some intuitive level that made them safer, less taboo, and less sinful. After all, in these fantasies, I didn’t have a choice. I didn’t have sexual agency. I wasn’t choosing to have sex. I wasn’t active. It wasn’t that I wanted to fantasize about non-consensual sex; rather, as a result of the purity culture and my suppression of my sexuality, this was the only kind of sex I could fantasize about.</p>

<p>When my husband and I began having sex, we found that the only way I could orgasm was to pretend our sex was non-consensual. It was as though imagining and miming being coerced was the only way I could truly let go, detach from myself, and give myself permission to feel sexual pleasure. Being an active sexual agent, even in my thoughts, had been a no-no for so long that this suppression had become hard-wired into my brain. It literally took us years to figure out a way for me to have orgasms without pretending that our sex was non-consensual. I have nothing against people who simply enjoy this sort of sex play or this sort of fantasies, and I’m not saying it’s bad. It’s just that I really wanted to be able to experience orgasm without having to pretend sex was non-consensual.</p>

<p>It’s been some years now, and things have gotten better. I can have orgasms without pretending our sex is non-consensual, and I now have sexual fantasies in which I am an active sexual agent. There are some things I’m still working on, because these sorts of thought patterns don’t go away overnight, but I’m confident that I’m on the right path and have a bright sexual future.</p>

<p>How did this happen to me? It’s simple, really. I spent the first twenty years of my life suppressing every sexual urge, thought, or desire. I literally became essentially asexual. Literally. My sexuality was dead, because I had killed it. I had sacrificed it on the alter of the purity culture in a desire to make myself pure and godly. And yet, I’d always been taught that once I was married I would experience carefree, romping, ecstatic, incredible sex the likes of which I could not imagine. There is a disconnect here. How is one supposed to go from being sexually suppressed and extinguished to being an active and fulfilled sexual being?</p>

<p>I was taught growing up that every sexual thought or desire outside of marriage is sin. Believing this, I spent twenty years working hard to keep from thinking about sex, and I succeeded. I was essentially asexual. And then, with my husband, I was suddenly supposed to think about sex. My mind rebelled. My indoctrination of my own brain had been all too successful. My sexual dysfunction was only natural.</p></blockquote>

… Schuller Wyatt was scheduled to appear on the Hour of Power broadcast where her brother Robert “Bobby” Schuller III preaches. But when word got out that Schuller Wyatt had written God and Boobs, she was unceremoniously dumped via email from a church executive who gave no explanation.</p>

<p>“I’m tired of religious bullies dictating to women how we should live our lives. In my work as a pastor, I counseled too many women who felt ashamed of their sexuality and were silenced into submission. I am trying to empower them to feel good about themselves.“</p>

<blockquote><p>Spiritual leaders have been guilty of teaching women to hide their figures in dumpy clothes, to avoid thinking about sex and to ignore their sexual desires. Whether Protestant or Catholic, most religious rules about sex result in women feeling their sexuality is shameful. Women in my religious circle won’t typically admit to their friends or pastors that they’ve felt this way, but they will tell their counselors. In the privacy of a safe setting, they talk of things like having to endure looks from their pastor that made them feel dirty. Making matters worse is the rampant hypocrisy in religion. The same leaders who set strict boundaries on sexuality are often exposed for exploiting sex in their private lives. When their sins come to light, they’re revealed as consumers of pornography, prostitution and illegal sex-enhancing drugs. Certainly, not all spiritual leaders are guilty of this kind of hypocrisy, but it is prevalent enough to cast a shadow on the world’s prominent religions.
The devout Christian women I know tend to heed their leaders’ advice. Every piece of clothing is viewed through the lens of lust. Will this shirt show too much cleavage? Is my hemline too short? Am I going to cause a man to sin? They end up thinking about their cleavage as much as the men around them do.
I once heard a pastor chide women in his church for wearing tops that were cut too low. If the congregation wasn’t thinking about breasts walking into the building, they were certainly thinking about them as they walked out. I heard nothing else the pastor said that day. I kept thinking to myself: How low it too low? Who is the appointed Cleavage Monitor? Who draws the line between sinner and saint?
Years ago, my brother told me that if a man is going to lust, he’s going to lust. You could put a girl in a potato sack and he’d still become aroused. It’s our own conscience that must resolve the questions of sexual expression and attire.</p>

<p>Enhanced by breasts, hips and figures that curve, a woman’s body is shaped by God. It’s a beautiful piece of art, meant to be alluring and sensual in all the right places. But religious women feel insecure about their curves to the point of layering on their clothes until they’ve covered every inch of their femininity.</p>

<p>This point was driven home by a friend, who told me about a film crew from a local news organization that was reporting on a major Christian women’s conference in her city. She knew about the situation because she worked at the conference behind the scenes. The crew was trying to wrap the shoot, but they couldn’t seem to get the footage they wanted. The hold-up? They needed an interview and couldn’t find a single woman, she was told, who looked like a cute, normal girl and not “a bag lady.”</p>

<p>Are women meant to live this way? Is this what God requires of us? Does God want us to feel shame about our sexuality? Women deserve a shame-free existence. They should explore, adore and adorn their shapes. There’s nothing shameful about a womanly figure that evokes sexual feelings, because women, like men, were designed to have sex. It’s natural. There are ways to embrace our figures, without putting them on display, to celebrate them and keep them sacred.</p></blockquote>

When Chrisitans discuss sex,</p>

<blockquote><p>Consent doesn’t enter into the picture, because if enthusiastic, positive consent is discussed, it might end up teaching people that healthy sexual relationships can and do happen outside of a marriage relationship. And then all hell breaks loose!</p></blockquote>

<p>http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/christians-idolize-virginity</p>

<p>http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2013/02/christian-bloggers-pushing-back-on-virginity.html</p>

<p>Dan Fincke of Cammels with Hammers points out that many <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2011/02/sex-and-apostasy/">parents who themselves lived a life of moderate libertinism are happy to have their children inculcated into a doctrine of asceticism they could never follow</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>When it is actually beneficial in practice for people to reject fundamentalist Christian restrictiveness about sex, they leave the church.  When they are married and raising children, suddenly they endorse a system of values that conveniently allows that only married people can have sex and that their teenage and young adult children cannot.</p>

<p>Religious people of this sort are some of the worst and most blithe and uncondemned species of hypocrites out there.  They condemn the same healthy process of normal sexual development they personally benefited from while considering themselves especially devout and moral people for “repenting” of their ways when all they did was get married and find the church suddenly extremely convenient to their sexual goals of monogamy and their desire that their teenage and young adult children remain chaste.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just came across one of the most condescending, self righteous and judgemental Christian tracts to shame young people about their lives I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>

<p><img class="center Satisfied, Teen Ager" src="/images/teenager1.jpg">
<img class="center Satisfied, Teen Ager" src="/images/teenager2.jpg"></p>

<blockquote><p>Within you there is an emptiness - a vacuum. You&#8217;ve tried to find satisfaction. Drinking, smoking, petting, indulging in shameful sex acts has not filled that void. Yet, you seek for greater thrills, you cultivate a deeper love for the pleasures of this world. You&#8217;ve tried to convince yourself that you are happy, but <em>HELL</em> rages within.</p>

<p><em>SOON!</em> you will stand before the almighty God on the judgment day and give an account of every dirty joke, curse word, evil action and neglected opportunity of being saved from all sin.</p>

<p><em>REPENTANCE</em> means confessing all our sins&#8230; <em>REPENTANCE</em> means forsaking all sin, a complete turning away from being a rebel, from ungodly friends, form conformity with the world, from secret sins and habits of the flesh, from filthy books and naked photographs, from dirty stories and unclean jokes, from everything and everybody that would hinder you from being one hundred percent for Jesus Christ&#8230;</p>

<p><em>REPENTANCE</em> means making restitution. In other words, make your back paths straight; make things right with those whom you have wronged. This includes taking back stolen property or paying back stolen money. Restitution involves asking of forgiveness of parents for improper attitudes towards them, disobedience, and disrespect.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course most tracts aren&#8217;t intended to convert people to Christianity, just to satisfy the &#8216;evangelist&#8217; that they are doing their job by presenting the very worst of Christian judgementalism. Jack Chick&#8217;s <a href="http://www.stufffundieslike.com/2013/02/catholic-bashing/">rabid anti-Catholic sentiment makes this clear</a>:</p>

<img class="center JTC Catholic Bashing" src="/images/catholic-bash3.jpg"></p>

<p>Of course, people giving out these tracts don&#8217;t care about how the recipients receive them, they are really only there to give out as many tracts as quickly as possible <a href="http://www.stufffundieslike.com/2012/11/tract-smack-down/">to appease other Christians</a>:</p>

<p>This week the US supreme court is assessing the contitutional validity of state laws prohibiting same-sex marriage. There is the potential to overturn California&#8217;s Proposition 8, and possibly the Defence of Marriage Act. A large number of millenials have been following the SCOTUS, with many changing their profile pictures to an equality symbol. Data from Pew Research show that while other demographic groups have relativly unchanged levels of support for same-sex marriage, <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2013/03/20/growing-support-for-gay-marriage-changed-minds-and-changing-demographics/">17% of millenials have changed their minds over the last 3 years</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/pew-gay-marriage.png" alt="Pew Gay Marriage" /></p>

<p>A range of significant Democratic figures have given their support to the campaign, like Hillary Clinton recently joining Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Obama himself stated his views &#8216;evolved&#8217; from discussions with his daughters, subtley refuting the argument that gay marriage is a threat to children. A number of Republican figures like Dick Cheney, Laura Bush, and Colin Powell have already come out in support of gay marriage, and recently another 75 Republicans added their support, including <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/02/republicans-urge-scotus-to-support-gay-marriage.html">former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman and former ebay CEO Meg Whitman</a>. Rob Portman, an original voter for DOMA, also changed his mind after <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/03/15/rob-portman-gay-marriage-son/1988375/">his son came out as gay</a>.</p>

<p>Bill O&#8217;Reilly has also <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2013/03/27/oreilly_gay_marriage_backers_have_compelling_argument_against_bible_thumpers.html">changed his view, on March 26 of the O&#8217;Reilly Factor</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS: I mean, I think the country&#8217;s views on [same-sex marriage] are changing, they&#8217;re changing dramatically.</p>

<p>O&#8217;REILLY: But why are they changing?</p>

<p>KELLY: Well, because I think the same-sex marriage advocates have done a credible job in getting out there and making their case&#8230; I had an interview with Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council. What is it about calling a marriage &#8211; calling a gay union a marriage that offends you. How does it hurt a traditional, or a heterosexual marriage? And I didn&#8217;t hear anything articulated that was particularly persuasive&#8230;</p>

<p>O&#8217;REILLY: …I agree with you 100-percent. <strong>The compelling argument is on the side of homosexuals</strong>. That&#8217;s where the compelling argument is. &#8216;We&#8217;re Americans, we <strong>just want to be treated like everybody else</strong>.&#8217;</p>

<p>That’s a compelling argument. And to deny that, you’ve got to have a very strong argument on the other side. And <strong>the other side hasn’t been able to do anything but thump the Bible</strong>.</p>

<p>KELLY: Their best argument, thus far, has been, &#8216;well, marriage is an institution that for 2,000 has been about a man and a woman creating babies.&#8217;</p>

<p>O&#8217;REILLY: That&#8217;s right.</p>

<p>O&#8217;REILLY: &#8230;I live in New York, New York has [gay marriage], <strong>I&#8217;m fine with it. I want all Americans to be happy</strong>, I do.</p></blockquote>

<p>With opposition to same-sex marriage seemingly in free-fall, extreme Religious Right figures are coming up with explanations for how this has happened. And rather than acknowledge that social media allows millenials to change their minds quickly, and that the demographics of the US are changing, they&#8217;d rather engage in <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/wnd-our-tiny-tots-are-taught-homosexuality-weve-even-broken-them-thumb-sucking">kooky conspiracy theories about a hidden population control agenda</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>One has to wonder if the bigger motive behind the homosexual agenda isn’t to secretly achieve voluntary population control: Perhaps the ultimate goal is to save the planet from the inevitable destruction of man-made climate change. One could conclude that the sustainability efforts behind Agenda 21 would greatly benefit from same-sex partners who would no longer pollute the planet with the unwanted carbon footprints of tiny feet. Even those diesel-spewing school buses could become a welcomed relic of the past if enough people stopped procreating.</p></blockquote>

<p>The idea that the gay rights movement is a covert conspiracy to destroy capitalism by reducing procreation has been picked up by Matt Hagee:</p>

<p>Susan Harris continues her theorising, worried about the influence that social media has over millenials:</p>

<blockquote><p>Chances are, if you’ve got a teenager on Facebook, they have been lured by curiosity to at least one of these sites. In addition to social media, well-known gay celebrities in comedy, news and music beat a steady drumbeat of tantalizing homosexual ideology for America’s youth…</p>

<p>Generation Q lives and breathes an intense obsession of their sexuality that is disturbing to outsiders. Insiders include gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transgenders, pansexuals and basically everyone who does not adhere to the archaic idea of a man and woman being attracted to each other, marrying and having children. More importantly, it consists of allies who loudly champion the cause for family and friends already immersed in this destructive culture…</p>

<p>We have reached the point where neither American laws nor accepted cultural norms will protect my rights as a Christian to protect my child from what my faith teaches is sinful and perverse behavior. Americans must not back down in the face of constant intimidation. The first step begins at home: naming the sin and teaching our children to love the sinner but hate the sin. <strong>The LGBT agenda is ensuring that our tiny tots are taught homosexuality before we’ve even broken them of thumb-sucking</strong>. By the time they are teenagers – feeling “different” like millions of teenagers before them – they are being sucked into the LGBTQ lifestyle because their parents and their communities put acceptance of man’s lusts above God’s law.</p>

<p>Our youth are embarking on a lonely, dark path of sexual confusion and its resulting sadness, disease and suicide. There will be no going back. Generation Q may have already slipped through our fingers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Clearly the only sane thing a God-fearing parent can do is to keep their tiny tots holed up in a basement for the first decade of life, away from the corrupting influence of the world.</p>

<p>Behind the claim that gays want to destroy capitalism is the concern that changing social mores and cultural norms, as well as efforts to reduce economic inequality will <a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/paul07/paul07_index.html">destroy the Religious Right</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Christians in the West have a habit of making all the depictions of biblical figures white. This is painfully evident in The Bible series on the History Channel. The series starts its Eurocentric presentation of Jewish scriptures with Adam and Eve as white supermodels:</p>

<p><img src="/images/adam-eve.jpg" alt="Adam and Eve as white supermodels" /></p>

<p>At least they figured out that &#8220;forbidden fruit&#8221; is a fig, long believed to be an aphrodisiac in the Middle East. The producers also cast Mohamen Mehdi Ouazanni as Satan, someone <a href="http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/television/barack-obama-lookalike-mohamen-mehdi-ouazanni-cast-as-satan-in-the-bible/story-e6frfmyi-1226600220510">many have commented has a resemblence to Barak Obama</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/satan-obama.jpg" alt="Barack Obama looks like Satan" /></p>

<p>While Jesus is shown as distinctively Causasian, Samson was cast as a black actor leading Reverend Wil Gafney to call the series <a href="http://www.wilgafney.com/2013/03/11/black-samson-white-women-on-the-history-channel">&#8220;a continuation of slave-holding racist exegesis.&#8221;</a> The December 2002 cover of Popular Mechanics featured a <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/forensics/1282186">reconstruction of the faces of males from around the time of Jesus</a>. The New Testament says that Jesus disappeared into crowds, and if Jesus looked like other men of the time this is what he would have looked like:</p>

<p><img src="/images/black-jesus-face.jpg" alt="Black Jesus by Popular Mechanics" /></p>

<p>The Irish producer Roma Downey chose to cast herself as Mary the mother of Jesus, and chose to give the role of Jesus of Nazareth to a similarly white skinned Portugese actor Diogo Morgado:</p>

<p><img src="/images/white-jesus.jpg" alt="White Jesus" /></p>

<p>If Jesus ever had hair this long, he&#8217;d probably get it stuck in his vice or his lathe. Europeans love to show Jesus with long hair, despite Paul&#8217;s teaching in 1 Corinthians 11:14 clearly specifying &#8220;Does not nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace for him&#8221;. In fact, many contemporary scholars have noted that the Corinthian church existed at a time when male prostitutes had longer hair than other men to make them stand out as homosexuals. And despite all this, ever since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_movement">Jesus movement</a> co-opted New Age culture of the 70&#8217;s, modern renditions of Jesus show him as a long haired white hippie.</p>

<p>But this isn&#8217;t the only way that Westerners present biblical stories specifically moulded to their target audience, against the grain of what the bible actually says. Western individualists love to read bible passages as written specifically for them, ignoring the original audience and context. For most of the history of Christianity, lay people did not read scriputre themselves, they had the bible read in a corporate context. It wasn&#8217;t until 1455 that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg_Bible">Johannes Gutenberg mass produced 180 bibles</a> and until 1561 that John Knox demanded universal education.</p>

<p>Now Americans complain that while most <a href="http://global.christianpost.com/news/dr-lamar-vest-on-why-owning-seven-bibles-is-not-enough-70608/">own four to seven bibles they hardly ever get time to read them</a>. Instead they&#8217;ll be coerced to read the bible <a href="http://au.christiantoday.com/article/Daily-Bible-reading-best-predictor-of-spiritual-growth/13987.htm">25 words at a time</a>. Not only are Westerners time-poor, they all too often seek a <a href="rachelheldevans.com/blog/bible-not-into-you">&#8220;reaffirmation of the individualistic, me-centered, and consumerist tendencies of American religious culture.&#8221;</a> Many megachurches are happy to give them a &#8220;seeker friendly&#8221; doctrine written by and for modern American individualists:</p>

<blockquote><p>Passages that were originally written for groups of people, and intended to be read and applied in a community setting (the nation of Israel, the various early churches, the first followers of Jesus), have been manipulated to communicate a personal, individual message&#8230;</p>

<p>We see this everywhere: in worship set lists that focus exclusively on individual worship, individual sin, and individual connection to God; in desk calendars that turn Jeremiah 29:11 (“For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord…”)  into a personal promise; in the disproportionate emphasis in our churches on personal Bible study, personal prayer, and one’s “personal walk with God.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Worse, publishers responding to people who like the sound of their own names will &#8220;personalize&#8221; the bible for them, massaging scripture into an ego stoking circlejerk. Isiah 53 no longer reads &#8220;he was pierced for <strong>our</strong> transgressions&#8221; but can be made to say &#8220;he was pierced for <strong>Rachel&#8217;s</strong> transgressions. He was crushed for <strong>Rachel&#8217;s</strong> iniquities.&#8221; The website lets you put in literally any name at all:</p>

<p><img src="/images/dahmer.jpg" alt="The bible according to Jeffrey Dahmer" /></p>

<h3>It ain&#8217;t in the bible, but it outta be</h3>

<p>This culture is happy to change the bible not only to suit the emotional desires of materialists but also to make it suit contemporary social and political needs. Often Jesus is not presented as a redeemer saving individuals into a community, but is presented as a &#8220;package deal&#8221; that will provide for individual emotional and physical wants and needs, so long as they conform to the social and political aims of the church of the day.</p>

<p>Making the message &#8220;culturally relevant&#8221; can lead to presenting cultural idiosyncrasies along with religious doctrines until the two become confused. Right wing Christians love to say phrases like &#8220;God helps those who help themselves&#8221;. When challenged on where in the bible it actually says it, they&#8217;ll usually respond &#8220;well it ain&#8217;t in the bible, but it outta be&#8221;. Other common platitudes like &#8220;When God closes a door he opens a window&#8221; might give comfort to those struggling with flatulence, but are similarly unscriptural.</p>

<p>Ultimately many Christians don&#8217;t view God though the bible, they view the bible through the lens of the culture they&#8217;re in, which is why their god&#8217;s actions and character reflect their own personal desires and perferences. When one&#8217;s understanding of the Christian God is grounded in pre-existing cultural and social assumptions, statements like this make sense:</p>

<p><img src="/images/god-husband.jpg" alt="God as husband" /></p>

<p>This &#8220;deal&#8221; is not the gospel of Christianity, it&#8217;s a <a href="http://ajoyfulvapour.tumblr.com/post/45499852946/this-is-a-load-of-crap-where-is-its-scriptual">load of crap, and a lie, and a load of bollocks</a>. If they don&#8217;t get these stupid ideas from the bible, where do they get them from? There is a widespread cultural assumption that &#8220;everyone knows&#8221; that god wants people to marry &#8220;the one&#8221; for them. Many Christians are happy to play into cultural anxieties about love, sex and singleness to present marriage as part of the &#8220;package deal&#8221; of Christianity. Dagmar Herzog describes the American religious right as pushing a regressive social agenda by painting a rosy picture of marriage, and building on the insecurities of sexual inexperience in youth:</p>

Author Dagmar Herzog examines the efforts of religious conservatives to influence sexual culture in the U.S. during the Bush Administration. Herzog claims widespread increases in religion-themed sex education, therapy, and medical research as examples.

&#8212;&#8211;

Has the conservative agenda come to dominate the national and international conversation on sexual rights?

Obama&#8217;s victory and the vote against abortion bans in Colorado and South Dakota brought some sexual rights back from the edge of a political precipice, but others remain in the balance.

Join scholars, journalists, and policy makers to talk about how we can help the new administration change policies and reframe national and international thinking on sexual rights.

Participants include Dagmar Herzog, author of Sex in Crisis: The New Sexual Revolution and the Future of American Politics and Professor of History, Lynn Paltrow, Executive Director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women, Nation columnist Katha Pollitt, and Faye Wattleton, Director of the Center for the Advancement of Women.

Discussant: Rosalind Petchesky, author of Sexuality, Health and Human Rights and Distinguished Professor of Political Science. Moderated by Michelle Fine, Distinguished Professor of Psychology at the Graduate Center, CUNY - City University of New York

Dagmar Herzog is a Professor of History at the Graduate Center, CUNY, where she focuses on modern European history, the history of sexuality, and the history of the religion. She has written three books, Sex after Fascism: Memory and Morality in Twentieth-Century Germany; Intimacy and Exclusion: Religious Politics in Pre-Revolutionary Bade; and, most recently, Sex in Crisis: The New Sexual Revolution and the Future of American Politics.  In addition to her books, she has edited or co-edited four volumes and has published numerous academic articles on the history of sexuality.</div>

<p>The Materialistic Western culture is built on functional saviours. Shampoo is sold to people by telling them that unclean hair makes them undesirable, then promising to make them beautiful if they buy more product. Targetting this culture with &#8220;seeker friendly&#8221; material often means presenting a relationship Jesus as a functional saviour, a means to an end for the individual, rather than an end in and of itself. &#8220;The most important relationship you can have &#8211; one that will make you a better husband and father &#8211; is a relationship with God&#8221; reads an altar call in one <a href="http://www.everystudent.com/features/wolves.html">mendacious promise of long lasting and happy marriages</a>. Another promises &#8221;<a href="http://www.everystudent.com/features/marriage.html">hope for a lasting marriage</a>&#8221; if only one accepts Jesus. Others offer Jesus as a way for <a href="http://www.everystudent.com/wires/toxic.html">men</a> and <a href="http://www.everystudent.com/wires/jenniferm.html">women</a> to stop looking at porn. People accepting these altar calls and praying their sinner&#8217;s prayers will never know what they&#8217;ve accepted unless they read the bible to understand what is actually in it, and what &#8220;outta be&#8221;.</p>

<h3>Myths and misinformation pushing shame and intimidation</h3>

<p>The relationships altar call comes after two and a half A4 pages of bullshit about how &#8220;Waiting to have sex with my wife will mean better sex in my marriage.&#8221; It launches into all the standard canards Christians have been told to believe &#8220;the more I bond with other girls, the less I&#8217;ll be able to bond with my future wife. It&#8217;s like a piece of scotch tape &#8211; the more you use it on different surfaces, the less it sticks to things.&#8221; When entire mission strategies are built around ignorance on sex and relationships, Christians will do anything in their power to promote misinformation. Because they are offering Chrsitianity as a solution to problems of their own making.</p>

<p>Abstinance only sex education programs reinforce ignorance in 30% of United States public schools. They <a href="http://www.siecus.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.ViewPage&amp;PageID=1199">teach canards like</a> “Condoms can never protect someone from the emotional problems that can result from multiple sexual partners and premature sexual activity.” And “AIDS can be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact.” They discourage the responsible use of barrier methods like condoms, teaching that “The only safe sex is in a marriage relationship where a man and a woman are faithful to each other for life.”</p>

<p>These programs not only promote the idea that premarital sex has risks, but demonises it as permanantly scarring. “If [a girl] has been involved in sexual activity…sexually, she is no longer a virgin, she is no longer pure, unspoiled, fresh&#8221; they teach. They warn that “The consequences of pre-marital sex include “guilt, disappointment, worry, depression, sadness, loneliness, and loss of self-esteem.” They warn 6th grade children &#8220;Going on this ride could change your life forever, result in poverty, heartache, disease, and even DEATH.” It goes on to say that many “will board this ride and come out losers.” The manual goads “did you know that sexual activity outside of the commitment of marriage could put YOUR FUTURE at risk?”</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t believe that they teach children that they&#8217;ll die, watch this:</p>

<p>These teachings encourage a culture of shame and permanent condemnation. In a survey, when researchers dropped a live cockroach into orange juice, then removed the cockroach and sterilised the juice, <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com.au/2013/02/the-psychology-of-christian-purity.html">the majority of participants wouldn&#8217;t drink it</a>. Paul Rozin, author of the study also found that <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-10-27/entertainment/0510260352_1_disgusting-paul-rozin-important-part">40% of participants would refuse to eat poo-shaped chocolate, or drink juice from a brand-new bedpan</a>. Even when people know that disgusting looking food is safe to eat, emotionally, many refuse. While many sins that the bible speaks against are presented as mistakes, conservative evangelicals always talk about sexual integrity in terms of purity. They encourage the view that anyone who isn&#8217;t a virgin is permanantly broken, corrupted, contaminated and that they cannot make themselves clean again.</p>

<h3>The overreach and failure of the purity doctrine</h3>

<p>Demonising pre-marital sex as permanantly scarring and unforgivable has created a culture in which people are afraid even to date. &#8220;There is no condom for the human heart&#8221; teach the fear mongers. They preach not only that virginity is the most important gift a girl can give her husband, but that they should be &#8220;emotional virgins&#8221; and not <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2011/09/love-virginity.html">&#8220;give away pieces of their heart.&#8221;</a> This is bullshit. And yet, it has almost lured a <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2012/10/what-i-learned-from-joshua-harris.html">whole generation out of dating until they are sure they can marry</a>. This hooks into the intuition that &#8220;everyone knows&#8221; that God will provide them with &#8220;the one&#8221;, which &#8220;outta be&#8221; in the bible there somewhere. Single Christian women who spend the last decade in the purity culture suddenly find themselves <a href="http://sydneyanglicans.net/life/daytoday/single_christian_female_30">ostracised and isolated as church ministries direct all their 30+ ministries to families</a>.</p>

<p>Many women have given up on wearing purity rings. For some, it&#8217;s because they <a href="http://gracefortheroad.com/2012/02/03/idontwait/">feel complete in their relationship with Jesus, and aren&#8217;t &#8220;waiting&#8221; anymore</a></p>

<blockquote><p>There are a lot of girls out there who don’t know who God is anymore – the God of their youth group years just isn’t working out. Back then, that God said to wait for sex until they are married, until He brings the right man along for a husband. They signed a card and put it on the altar and pledged to wait&#8230;</p>

<p>Some of them have prayed their whole lives for a husband, and he hasn’t shown up. They’ve heard the advice to “be the woman God made you to be, focus on that, and then the husband will come.” They’ve read “Lady in Waiting,” gotten super involved in church and honed their domestic skills.</p>

<p>More than a decade ago, a youth leader handed them a photocopied poem in Sunday School written to them from “God” that said, “The reason you don’t have anyone yet is because you’re not fully satisfied in Me. You have to be satisfied with Me and then when you least expect it, I’ll bring you the person I meant for you.”</p>

<p>&#8230;Many of them – if they’re honest – will tell you that time has passed, and it’s wrecking their view of God.</p></blockquote>

<p>Others have given up on the culture of bullying and intimidation that <a href="http://sexetc.org/info-center/post/why-i-stopped-wearing-a-purity-ring/">accompanies the purity culture</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Originally, when I made the commitment to wait until marriage, I really only saw my ring as a symbol of how personally valuable my virginity was to me. However, after I saw how readily my peers bullied and mocked girls who they thought were sexually active, my ring seemed like more of a constant reminder of how dirty and useless people might think I was if I wasn’t a virgin anymore.</p></blockquote>

<p>For some, it&#8217;s the knowledge that <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1802108/">95% of Americans have sex before marriage</a>, or that <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2768056/">Five years after taking a virginity pledge, 82% of pledgers denied having ever pledged</a>. Others note that even in Southern Baptist churches <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3156853/">70% of engaged Christians quietly have sex before marrying</a>. Many women who hit this inevitable conclusion are finding the courage to speak out about the <a href="http://www.prodigalmagazine.com/the-day-i-turned-in-my-v-card/">deep and long lasting damage of the purity culture</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p> I broke a barrier and gave up an idea I’d held onto as a “Good Christian Girl” for a long, long time. If you grew up in American Christian culture, you know that a statement like mine is one of the most life changing, socially desolating, parentally disappointing pronouncements you can make. Especially if you’re a girl.</p>

<p> But I don’t care anymore; I’m done with virginity.</p>

<p> I’m done with that word and that idea. I’m done defining myself, my past and my future, in terms of who’s what has been where, or hasn’t. I’m done with stories for virgins and non-virgins, promises and praises, and sentiments of “restoration” that just push forward bulldozer loads of this horrible twisted shame.</p></blockquote>

<p>Others are speaking out for those who have <a href="http://deeperstory.com/i-am-damaged-goods/">been damaged by the notion that their sexual past is keeping them back from being a Christian</a></p>

<blockquote><p> I was nineteen years old and crazy in love with Jesus when that preacher told an auditorium I was “damaged goods” because of my sexual past. He was making every effort to encourage this crowd of young adults to “stay pure for marriage.” He was passionate, yes, well-intentioned, and he was a good speaker, very convincing indeed.</p>

<p> And he stood up there and shamed me, over and over and over again.</p>

<p> Oh, he didn’t call me up to the front and name me. But he stood up there and talked about me with such disgust, like I couldn’t be in that real-life crowd of young people worshipping in that church. I felt spotlighted and singled out amongst the holy, surely my red face announced my guilt to every one&#8230;</p>

<p> And so here, now, I’ll stand up and say it, the way I wish someone had said it to me fifteen years ago when I was sitting in that packed auditorium with my heart racing, wrists aching, eyes stinging, drowning and silenced by the imposition of shame masquerading as ashes of repentance:</p>

<p> “So, you had sex before you were married.</p>

<p> It’s okay.</p>

<p> Really. It’s okay.</p>

<p> There is no shame in Christ’s love. Let him without sin cast the first stone. You are more than your virginity – or lack thereof – and more than your sexual past.</p></blockquote>

<p>Others who kept their virginity are also <a href="http://www.elizabethesther.com/2013/01/virginity-new-improved.html">pushing back on the purity culture that teaches that non-sexual relationships are as dangerous as sexual ones</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p> Yes, I was a virgin on my wedding day. Then again, I was only 20. Yes, remaining a virgin until my wedding day saved me from some romantic heartbreak. Then again, I’ve had other heartbreaks. Yes, chastity is special. Then again, so are lots of virtues. Except, as a 20 year old bride, I thought virginity was extra-extra special and would win me lots of special prizes like: a happily ever after marriage.</p>

<p> It took me a long time to realize I idolized virginity. I kept saying I was just promoting virtue and chastity and purity! Nothing wrong with pushing purity, right? Nothing wrong with Being Good!</p>

<p> Like other Christians, I talked about the “sacrifice” of abstinence. There were princess-themed books about saving our first kiss. Some of us wore purity rings and made pledges to our Daddies not to have sex until we’re married.</p>

<p> Ultimately, we implied that <strong>a woman’s inherent worth and dignity could be measured by whether or not a man has touched her</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>As women who spend their young adult years believing that pre-marital sex is &#8220;not all it&#8217;s cracked up to be&#8221; start hitting struggles in their own &#8220;perfect&#8221; marriages, the church is happy to offer a whole industry of Christian sex advice.</p>

<h3>Race to the bottom</h3>

<p>This gospel offers &#8220;perfect&#8221; sex in a &#8220;perfect&#8221; marriage so long as one accepts the &#8220;package deal&#8221; of White Jesus with the cultural vestments of looking, sounding and voting Christian.</p>

<blockquote><p>A FURIOUS Peter Costello has rounded on a Christian cult for suggesting the Victorian bushfires were divine retribution for the state&#8217;s abortion laws, describing it as &#8220;beyond the bounds of decency&#8221;.</p>

<p>Just three weeks ago, the former federal treasurer sent a video message to a special Australia Day prayer meeting organised by Catch the Fire Ministries leader Danny Nalliah.</p>

<p>But he reacted angrily to a statement by Mr Nalliah yesterday recalling a dream concerning the consequences of Victorian abortion legislation that became law last year.</p>

<p>The preacher claimed God&#8217;s &#8220;conditional protection&#8221; had been &#8220;removed from the nation of Australia, particular Victoria, for approving the slaughter of innocent children in the womb&#8221;.</p>

<p>&#8220;To link the death and the suffering of bushfire victims to other political events is appalling, heartless and wrong,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those who have suffered deserve every support and sympathy. It is beyond the bounds of decency to try to make moral or political points out of such a tragedy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Nalliah&#8217;s full prophesy <a href="https://signposts02.wordpress.com/2009/02/14/nalliah-prophecy-claims-fall-short/">said this</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“I saw a man firing randomly with a weapon at people on the streets and many were falling dead. I was very disturbed and was crying. Then the scene changed and I saw fire everywhere with flames burning very high and uncontrollably. With this I awoke from my dream with the interpretation as the following words came to me in a flash from the Spirit of God,  ‘My wrath is about to be released upon Australia, in particular Victoria, for approving the slaughter of the innocent children in the womb.  Now, call on My people to repent and pray!’”</p></blockquote>

<p>This is false prophesy; there have been no major mass murders since 1996. If the Victorian bushfires really were God&#8217;s judgement for abortion legislation, then where is the gunman? In reality, <a href="/blog/2013/01/20/rick-perry/">Australian gun control works much better than school prayer</a>.</p>

<p>Nalliah also incorrectly predicted that <a href="http://www.christian-witness.org/blog/2007/11/26/catch-the-fire%E2%80%93sequel/">Howard would win in the 2007 election before stepping aside for Costello to become Prime Minister</a>. He <a href="http://www.crikey.com.au/2007/08/14/costello-gods-own-prime-minister/">likens himself to the prophet Samuel anointing David</a> &#8220;The Lord spoke clearly to me about how Prophet Samuel in the Word of God was sent to anoint David as the future King of Israel&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>I thank the Lord that I just had a one to one meeting with Peter Costello [and Howard]&#8230; The Lord had given me a clear prophetic Word for both of them and I thank Him I was able to deliver His Word in addition to praying with both of these Federal Government Leaders&#8230;</p>

<p>I will boldly declare that Prime Minister John Howard will be re-elected in the November election (if the Body of Christ unites in prayer and action) and pass the leadership onto Peter Costello sometime after.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nalliah waters down his prophesy by hedging his bets on whether Christians pray the right way, creating an &#8220;out&#8221; for his faulty prophesy. As Rev Dr Gordon Moyes notes, &#8220;True prophets never give a “conditional” word of prophecy.&#8221; Moyes goes on to note that</p>

<blockquote><p>The majority of patients coming to the psychiatrists I have been responsible for employing in Wesley Mission’s Mental Health Hospitals claim God speaks to them. In other Christian circles and in Christian books, I note some people seek to get their own way by using God speaking to them as almost a way of stopping any questioning of their ideas.</p></blockquote>

<p>The American televangelist Kenneth Copeland confirmed Nalliah’s prophetic anointing of John Howard as Prime Minister, declaring that <a href="http://jmm.aaa.net.au/articles/20588.htm">Howard was “God’s man in Australia”</a>.</p>

<p>The Australian recounts the &#8220;preparation&#8221; (anointing as God&#8217;s elect) that happened with Costello:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr Nalliah met Mr Costello ahead of the 2007 election to &#8220;prepare&#8221; him for the prime ministership. A church member publicly recounted an episode where &#8220;the spirit of God suddenly moved me to cry out in the loud Aboriginal-like tongue followed by the shouting out several times of &#8216;the honourable Peter Costello, prime minister-elect of Australia&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>And just ahead of an Australia Day prayer meeting, Mr Nalliah announced: &#8220;Our silent prayer is that Peter &#8230; will be here to take the leadership of the party and lead the nation into victory as prime minister.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Nalliah <a href="http://www.christian-witness.org/blog/2007/07/13/pentecostal-disgrace-catch-the-fire-honouring-the-late-frank-houston/">honoured the self-consessed child molester Frank Houston as the greatest influence on his ministry</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The apostle Paul said that when he came to the church at Corinth it wasn’t with wise and persuasive words but it was with a demonstration of the Holy Spirit’s power&#8230; And that’s exactly how I knew Pastor Frank Houston. He was a man who moved in the power of the Holy Ghost. His heart was for real salvations, real healings, and real deliverances. I was fortunate enough to be a guest in his house on numerous occasions.. He was an inspiration not just to me but to many other spiritual sons and daughters throughout this nation.</p>

<p>I love Papa Frank with all my heart. I wish I could give him a big hug.</p></blockquote>

<p>Pastor Bob Cotton goes on to elaborate about his and Nalliah&#8217;s imitation of Houston&#8217;s techniques:</p>

<blockquote><p>I would ring him up sometimes and I’d say, ‘Pastor Frank. This devil - I couldn’t shift it the other day. What do you reckon?’ And he’d start to tell me a few little insights and different things that he’d known in the past, and we’ve seen many people come into freedom&#8230; It’s my honour to stand here today and say Pastor Frank wasn’t just a father in the faith to me, he was one of my closest mates and I love him. I cherish his memory and, like Danny, I wish he were here so I could give him a great big hug tonight because there was nobody quite like [him]</p></blockquote>

<p>Houston was expelled from his denomination for the destructive effect that his sexual abuse had on the church <a href="http://www.christian-witness.org/blog/2007/11/26/cetf-catch-the-fire-a-letter-to-the-editor/">and on victims</a>. By Nalliah&#8217;s own confession, he did not preach with logic and reason, but with signs and wonders. Given Houston&#8217;s history of sexually abusing multiple boys he was clearly not inspired or empowered by the Holy Spirit, and his signs and wonders were faked. Nalliah has learned to perform all of his spurious miracles from his spiritual father, refining the techniques and making even more aggrandised claims of raising three people from the dead.</p>

<p>Now Nalliah is running for office, hoping for a resurgence of Tea Party hysteria to propel an anti-Islamic, climate change denialist agenda into parliament.  Nalliah previously tried to <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/federal-election/gillard-bid-to-win-back-christians-20100805-11krh.html#ixzz2KepvdQfT">smear the Prime Minister for her atheism</a>. This sounds like the hysteria of Tea Party style dominionist rhetoric, claiming that the country was started on Christian values, and the only way to hold up democracy is to have Christian leaders occupying every leadership position.</p>

<blockquote><p>Danny Nalliah&#8230; released a statement giving five reasons not to vote Labor: it would be a vote for the Greens, Prime Minister Julia Gillard is in a de facto relationship, she is childless, she is an atheist, and she refused to take an oath on the Bible.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nalliah&#8217;s politics <a href="http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/new-political-party-rise-up-australia-wants-muslim-intake-cuts/story-fndo1gb8-1226575716789">have attracted discussion</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Pastor Daniel”, of Catch the Fire Ministries, says a conversation with Jesus that went from 3.40am to 6am one morning prompted his move to Australia.</p>

<p>Since arriving here he has claimed that Victoria’s abortion laws caused the Black Saturday bushfires and that his prayers have brought dead people back to life.</p>

<p>He declared Prime Minister Julia Gillard a heathen “living in sin” and former Greens leader Bob Brown an “openly practising homosexual” and said that he felt sick to the stomach watching them shake hands.</p>

<p>Rise Up Australia will push for cuts to Australia’s “Muslim intake”, for an end to multiculturalism and for protection of Australia’s Judaeo-Christian heritage&#8230;</p>

<p>Climate change skeptic Christopher Monckton spoke at the launch, giving a very graphic description of abortions and leading a round of patriotic cheers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Using abortion as a highly emotional topic as a <a href="http://localhost:4321/blog/2013/01/03/rentier-theology/">smokescreen for an agenda that is factually and morally bankrupt is a common tactic for extreme right wing politics</a>. Nalliah claims to be protecting Australia&#8217;s &#8220;Judeo Christian&#8221; heritage, a classic racist dog whistle. The RUA claim they want &#8220;To promote harmony, freedom and tolerance among Australians; specifically we oppose multiculturalism&#8221;. Great. Nalliah in 2004 called for Christians to <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1217824.htm">&#8220;pull down Satan&#8217;s strongholds&#8221;, including brothels and gambling places, mosques and temples</a>.</p>

<p>By claiming Christianity as the inspiration for their extremist politics, Nalliah and Monkton may pick up a small number of votes, but will continue the perception that Chrisitanity is strongly tied to a right wing agenda. If Christians themselves don&#8217;t speak out against this, it will give significant credance to those who want to wipe all religion from public life in Australia.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/bible-gun.jpg" alt="Bible used to justify weapons today" /></p>

<p>Throughout history, the bible has been used as justification for various wars. Dr. Eric Seibert suggests that modern readers <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/2013/02/when-the-good-book-is-bad-challenging-the-bibles-violent-portrayals-of-god/">should be mindful of the consequences of</a> a literal interpretation of problematic Old Testament passages:</p>

<blockquote><p>What happens when reading the Bible pushes people away from God rather than leads them closer to God?</p>

<p>If we feel compelled to accept what we read at face value, and are forbidden from asking honest questions about the troublesome texts we encounter, we run the risk of using the Bible in ways that may harm others</p></blockquote>

<p>In many Old Testament passages, Seibert writes, &#8220;lethal violence is condoned and sometimes even celebrated.  Passages like these create significant problems for Christian readers.&#8221; He <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/2013/02/when-the-bible-sanctions-violence-must-we/">continues</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>It is extremely dangerous to endorse violent texts like these. Tragically, this kind of approval has often led to future acts of violence against others&#8230;</p>

<p>As Christians, we have a moral obligation to critique the assumption that violence is somehow “virtuous,” in spite of what the Bible suggests on numerous occasions.</p>

<p>Violence is not a virtue. It is not a fruit of the spirit or a mark of discipleship&#8230; There are no moral grounds for slaughtering babies, infants, or toddlers. Yet the Bible justifies their extermination on more than one occasion.</p>

<p>Surely, those of us who follow the prince of Peace, the God of Life, must raise our voices in protest and object. We must say, “This is not right!” Such violence is never justifiable and should never be condoned.</p></blockquote>

<p>Seibert <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/2013/02/learning-to-read-the-bible-nonviolently/">suggests that readers engage with violence by trying to empathise with the victims</a>. This would be in line with Jesus&#8217;s teaching on the golden rule.</p>

<p>The question he&#8217;s getting at is whether violence in the Old Testament demonstrates inspiration if it must be resolved with an apparent contradiction with the incarnation of Logos. Working though these issues and understanding the history and interpreting the OT though an NT lens, without interposing modern secular moral standards.</p>

<blockquote><p>Reading this way sensitizes us to the problem of violence in these texts and keeps us from simplistically classifying such moral atrocities as good.</p>

<p>The conquest narrative in Joshua 6-11 reminds us that religious violence is extremely dangerous because it gives divine sanction to behaviors that in any other context would be deemed immoral. Moreover, if one assumes the narrative was intended to bolster the political ambitions of King Josiah, it stands as a sober reminder of the way political leaders sometimes use religion to promote their own agendas.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>There is a funny thing about history. Even though there are countless books waiting to be investigated and read, myriad articles from the times, and an abundance of other evidence, we human beings would <a href="https://mabworld.wordpress.com/2012/02/27/the-fundamentalist-history-they-dont-want-you-to-know/">rather have someone else — one of our contemporaries — tell us what it is</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>As George Orwell opined in <em>Ninteen Eighty Four</em>, &#8220;whoever controls the present controls the past&#8221;.
Even though the US senate in 1797 that &#8221;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tripoli">the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion</a>,&#8221; it&#8217;s become common to hear right wing Christians insist the opposite:</p>

<p><img src="/images/jesus-constitution.jpg" alt="Jesus giving the US constitution to the founding fathers" /></p>

<p>Demographic changes in the United States mean that white evangelical Christians are a smaller and smaller voting bloc. As the Religious Right attempting to broaden their base to black and latino Christians, they emphasise anti-abortion and anti-gay positions, and try to downplay their history of segregationalist and White Supremacist links. They also try to claim that they have always been against legal access to abortions, despite <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5502785">evidence to the contrary</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Although various Roman Catholic groups denounced the ruling, and Christianity Today complained that the Roe decision “runs counter to the moral teachings of Christianity through the ages but also to the moral sense of the American people,” the vast majority of evangelical leaders said virtually nothing about it; many of those who did comment actually applauded the decision. W. Barry Garrett of Baptist Press wrote, “Religious liberty, human equality and justice are advanced by the Supreme Court abortion decision.” Indeed, even before the Roe decision, the messengers (delegates) to the 1971 Southern Baptist Convention gathering in St. Louis, Missouri, adopted a resolution that stated, “we call upon Southern Baptists to work for legislation that will allow the possibility of abortion under such conditions as rape, incest, clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother.” W.A. Criswell, former president of the Southern Baptist Convention and pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas, expressed his satisfaction with the Roe v. Wade ruling. “I have always felt that it was only after a child was born and had a life separate from its mother that it became an individual person,” the redoubtable fundamentalist declared, “and it has always, therefore, seemed to me that what is best for the mother and for the future should be allowed.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Religious Right wants to paint themselves as having always been anti-abortion, and tends to be quiet on their position about racism and civil rights. The Republicans have a history of inviting White Supremicist speakers to the Conservative Political Action Comitee, while at the same time trying to broaden their base to black voters. In fact, one of the biggest issues to galvinise white evangelical voters is opposition to the civil rights movement. Paul Weyrich of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress said:</p>

<blockquote><p>“What galvanised the Christian community was not abortion, school prayer, or the ERA. I am living witness to that because I was trying to get those people interested in those issues and I utterly failed. What changed their mind was Jimmy Carter’s intervention against the Christian schools, trying to deny them tax-exempt status on the basis of so-called de-facto segregation.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The religious right is now attempting to get black voters to join an anti-gay campaign, claiming that they were always on the side of civil rights. Matt Barber, the law dean of Liberty University (founded on pro-segregationalist grounds by Jerry Falwell) <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/matt-barber-whose-idol-backed-segregation-lectures-everyone-else-about-civil-rights-movement">claimed that the gay movement has &#8220;cynically co-opted and hijacked the language of the very, very noble civil rights movement and applied it to their disordered lifestyle.”</a></p>

<p>Next thing they&#8217;ll try and claim that Chrsitians have always been <a href="http://www.lva.virginia.gov/lib-edu/education/psd/nation/halifax.htm">against slavery</a>. When the Theistic Evolution crowd convinces more Christians of the scientific truth of evolution (that it is more than &#8220;just a theory&#8221;), they&#8217;ll claim that Christians always thought Genesis was compatible with science. And when the numbers of Americans opposing gay marriage drops they will next claim that they always supported gay rights. <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/survey-less-americans-believe-homosexuality-is-a-sin-nations-view-evolving-with-obamas-88141/">44% of Americans believed that homosexuality is a sin in September 2011, dropping to 37% in November 2012</a>, and <a href="http://www.lifeway.com/ArticleView?storeId=10054&amp;article=research-same-sex-marriage-civil-rights-issue-americans-say">64% think same-sex marriage is inevitable</a>. Is it because hollywood is pushing a campaign? Is it because political correctness is popular? Or is it because the media has exposed how, if evangelicals had their way, homosexuality would have the death penalty, like it is now in Uganda?</p>

<p>The more that Christians understand of their own history, the more they&#8217;ll start to realise that many of their key doctrines (like the idea that all of the bible is literally true and without error) are actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention_conservative_resurgence">new inventions</a>.</p>
