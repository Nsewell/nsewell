<div class="entry-content"><h3>10 Questions every Christian should answer</h3>

<h3>Is it OK to ask questions</h3>

<blockquote><p>I am tired of carrying evangelical expectations on my shoulders</p><footer><strong>Dan Haseltine (Jars of Clay)</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.danhaseltine.com/blog/2012/7/19/an-unfinished-record-an-uncharted-path.html'>www.danhaseltine.com/blog/2012/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Most of the people I’ve encountered are looking not for a religion to answer all their questions but for a community of faith in which they can feel safe asking them&#8230; Our best answers in defense of Christianity have always been useless clanging cymbals unless our lives have inspired the world to ask.</p><footer><strong>Rachel Held Evans</strong> <cite><a href='http://rachelheldevans.com/ready-with-answer'>rachelheldevans.com/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<h3>Does my church have all the answers</h3>

<p>Enns - club baby seals
We have the one true and final revelation on all issues, including non-salvation issues.
My opinion on scripture is the one true and only way blessed by God and all other Christians who disagree on these issues must be wrong. Please pray for them, to make them see our side of the argument, since it must be God&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>Pray that God will give me the truth
Pray that other people will see things my way</p>

<h2>Is there room in my church for people who respectfully disagree?</h2>

<p>http://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/2012/08/is-christianity-a-tribalistic-religion-sort-of-looks-that-way/</p>

<blockquote><p>People are increasingly afraid to voice alternative views; to argue a different case than the dominant line, for fear of being verbally abused and/or socially isolated. People are afraid to go public through fear of being crushed. This is appalling, more characteristic of a cult than of a church. I understand the desire to safeguard the truth. I too am passionate about truth, but the irony is that truth is the first casualty of efforts to stifle healthy and robust debate.<br/>It is a sign of lack of confidence in the truth that we attempt to shut down efforts to understand it better, and if the only people we listen to are those who agree with us.</p><footer><strong>Rev Dr Keith Mascord</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.fatherdave.org/article/article_636.html'>www.fatherdave.org/article/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<h3>Why is it hard to admit our mistakes?</h3>

<p>The Ivory tower
Identifying people by their team, their group over their individual beliefs, attitudes and opinions
Tolerance &amp; liberalism
Dog eating chicken fucking
Social rules made to moral commands - Manichean dualism
Light dark night day spirit flesh
Not throwing baby out with bathwater
-> we can do better</p>

<h3>Song of Songs</h3>

<p>NET vs NIV</p>

<h4>Is a lover to be intoxicated by love, or sex?</h4>

<p><img src="images/goblet.jpg" title="Wine in modern goblet" alt="wine" /></p>

<blockquote><p>Your navel is a rounded goblet / that never lacks blended wine. (NIV11)  <br/>Your navel is a round mixing bowl / may it never lack mixed wine! (NET)</p></blockquote>


<p>Does the word &#8216;navel&#8217; (שֹׁרֶר shorer) refer to the navel or the vulva?</p>

<p>NET translation note:
The noun is a hapax legomenon, appearing in the OT only here. There is debate whether it means &#8220;navel&#8221; or &#8220;vulva&#8221;:
(1) Lys and Pope suggest that שֹׁרֶר is related to Arabic srr (&#8220;secret place, pudenda, coition, fornication&#8221;). They suggest that this is contextually supported by three factors:
  (a) His descriptive praise of her is in ascending order, beginning with her feet and concluding with her hair. The movement from her thighs (7:1b), to her vulva (7:2a), and then to her waist (7:2b) would fit this.
  (b) The descriptive comparison to a glass of wine would be grotesque if her navel were in view - her navel was moist or filled with liquid? - but appropriate if her vulva were in view.
  (c) The navel would be a somewhat synonymous reference to the belly which is already denoted by בִּטְנֵךְ (bitnekh, &#8220;belly&#8221;) in the following line. Because 7:1-7 does not use synonymous parallelism, the term שֹׁרֶר would have to refer to something other than the belly.</p>

<p>(2) The term שֹׁרֶר denotes &#8220;navel&#8221;:
 (a) It may be related to the bi-consonantal noun שֹׁר (shor, &#8220;navel, umbilical cord&#8221;) (Prov 3:8; Ezek 16:4).
 (b) Mishnaic Hebrew שָׁרָר (sharar) denotes &#8220;navel, umbilical cord&#8221; (Jastrow 1634 s.v. שָׁרָר). For example, in a midrash on the Book of Numbers, the noun שֹׁרֶר appears in an allusion to Song 7:3 to justify the seating of the Sanhedrin in the middle of the synagogue: &#8220;As the navel (שֹׁרֶר) is placed in the centre of the body, so are the Sanhedrin&#8230;&#8221; (Num. Rab. 1:4). On the other hand, the meaning &#8220;vulva&#8221; never appears in Mishnaic Hebrew. Therefore, apart from this disputed usage there is no evidence that this term was ever used in this manner in Hebrew.
 (c) Rather than שֹׁרֶר being related to Arabic sirr (&#8220;pudenda&#8221;), it could just as easily be related to the Arabic noun surr &#8220;navel.&#8221; It is methodologically more sound to define שֹׁרֶר as &#8220;navel&#8221; than as &#8220;vulva.&#8221;
 (d) The nuance &#8220;navel&#8221; is not as out of line contextually as Lys and Pope suggest. The navel would not be out of place in the ascending order of praise because the בִּטְנֵךְ (&#8220;abdomen&#8221;) which follows may be viewed as both above and below the navel. The figurative association of the שֹׁרֶר as a mixing bowl filled with wine does not imply that this bodily part must actually be moist or filled with liquid as Pope suggests. The point of comparison is not physical or visual but one of function, i.e., it is intoxicating. The comparison of the navel to a mixing bowl of wine is no more out of line than the comparison of the belly to a heap of wheat in the next line. In fact, the two go together - she is both the &#8220;drink&#8221; and &#8220;food&#8221; for Solomon. The shape of the navel is as congruent with the metaphor of the &#8220;round bowl&#8221; as the vulva; both are round and receding.</p>

<p>(3) Since both terms are derived from the same geminate root - Hebrew שֹׁרֶר and Arabic srr - it is more prudent to take the term as a synecdoche of whole (lower region) for the parts (including navel and vulva). The attempt to decide between these two options may be illegitimately splitting hairs. See K&amp;D 18:123; J. S. Deere, &#8220;Song of Solomon,&#8221; BKCOT, 199-200; D. Lys, &#8220;Notes sur de Cantique,&#8221; VTSup 17 (1969): 171-78; M. H. Pope, Song of Songs (AB), 617; G. L. Carr, Song of Solomon (TOTC), 157.</p>

<h4>Can parallels between Song of Songs and other poetry add to the richness of the metaphors?</h4>

In the poem in the third papyrus of <a href="http://jewishchristianlit.com/Texts/ANEmrg/pBeatty.html" title="The papyri of the Chester Beatty">Chester Beatty</a> the image of a Gazelle is used:</p>

<blockquote><p>I wish you would come quickly to your <em>sister</em><br/>
 like a swiftly running gazelle on the plain,<br/>
with stumbling feet, and weary to the bone, <br/>
because it is gripped with fear.  <br/>
Hunter and hounds are in hot pursuit, <br/>
but they can’t even see it for the dust. <br/>
It regards a place of rest as a trap  <br/>
and takes the river as a road <br/>
Then you will reach my cave <br/>
even before getting your hand kissed four times <br/>
You are in pursuit of your sister’s love <br/>
since, my friend, the Golden One has chosen her for you.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Context</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Why do Adam and Eve have belly buttons?</p></li>
<li><p>How could a 600 year old man have built a floating zoo?
Noah&#8217;s flood
Is it a metaphor? Not really; it&#8217;s a misappropriated narrative of a Sumerian king, Ziusudra. Could a 600 year old man have single handedly built a boat the size of a destroyer out of wood? Of course not.
Firstly, was Noah really 595? Probably not;</p></li>
</ol>


<p>How could someone in that era possibly live beyond 500?
It&#8217;s possible that a scribe reading the pre-cuineform tablet mistook the base-10 numeric writing system for a base-60 one.
Firstly, Noah was 83, the ages of many in the old testament were accidentally multiplied by over 60 by the error of scribes.
Matthew Henry provides this insightful explanation
That which is especially observable is that they all lived very long; not one of them died till he had seen the revolution of almost eight hundred years, and some of them lived much longer, a great while for an immortal soul to be imprisoned in a house of clay. The present life surely was not to them such a burden as commonly it is now, else they would have been weary of it; nor was the future life so clearly revealed then as it is now under the gospel, else they would have been impatient to remove to it: long life to the pious patriarchs was a blessing and made them blessings. 1. Some natural causes may be assigned for their long life in those first ages of the world. It is very probable that the earth was more fruitful, that the productions of it were more strengthening, that the air was more healthful, and that the influences of the heavenly bodies were more benign, before the flood, than afterwards. Though man was driven out of paradise, yet the earth itself was then paradisiacal&#8211;a garden in comparison with its present wilderness-state: and some think that their great knowledge of the creatures, and of their usefulness both for food and medicine, together with their sobriety and temperance, contributed much to it; yet we do not find that those who were intemperate, as many were (Luke xvii. 27), were as short-lived as intemperate men generally are now. 2. It must chiefly be resolved into the power and providence of God. He prolonged their lives, both for the more speedy replenishing of the earth and for the more effectual preservation of the knowledge of God and religion, then, when there was no written word, but tradition was the channel of its conveyance. All the patriarchs here, except Noah, were born before Adam died; so that from him they might receive a full and satisfactory account of the creation, paradise, the fall, the promise, and those divine precepts which concerned religious worship and a religious life: and, if any mistake arose, they might have recourse to him while he lived, as to an oracle, for the rectifying of it, and after his death to Methuselah, and others, that had conversed with him: so great was the care of Almighty God to preserve in his church the knowledge of his will and the purity of his worship.</p>

<p>Could Noah have built a destroyer from wood? No, but he could have built a 60 metre barge.</p>

<p>Would a 7 metre flood destroy the world?  No, but it would flood the Euphrates river valley.</p>

<p>Euphrates River flood of 2900 BC
The Ark&#8217;s size is an impossibility
But a barge of around 60 metres long, carrying not &#8216;every living creature&#8217; but all of Noah&#8217;s gold, silver and about 200 of his livestock is entirely believable.
Thus, the ark should not be seen as a literal account o fthe entire world flooding.
Neither is it purely a metaphor: there was likely a real flood of the Euphrates River in 2900 BC.
Epic of Gilgamesh</p>

<p>Adam and Eve
No literal Adam
Francis Collins admits that there would have been 10,000 humans 100,000 years ago
John Stott - Cain would line up with human culture 40,000 years ago
Why does God do nothing for 40+ thousand years
- If there is no literal Adam and Eve, how can there be original sin
If we aren&#8217;t sure about adam and eve, how can we be sure that Jesus is the salvation for all sins</p>

<p>Rachel Held Evans <a href="http://rachelheldevans.com/sunday-morning">describes herself</a> as &#8220;tired of being seen as a project and a prayer request because I believe the earth is more than 6,000 years old&#8221;</p>

<p>Original sin?
Humans have had language for over 100k, and art and culture for at least 40k. Clearly, they have all the precursors to modern life.
At what point does man become morally responsible for his actions?
Ecclesiasties - Eccl3.11
Isn&#8217;t it fundamentally immoral for God to impose free will? To &#8220;set eternity in the hearts of men&#8221; as some Bibles translate?
Didn&#8217;t humans have near to our level of rational understanding and inquisition?</p>

<p>Doesn&#8217;t this mean that original sin condemns humans after Adam, and before Jesus?
If God is a part of acting to modify humans, to change the minds of humans, or at some point starts judging them when they reach the arbitrary point of rationality.
Does God judge a stupid or mentally handicapped person today? If so, how did He not judge a species that had less mental ability 100,000 years ago.</p>

<p>Do we have free will? If so, what is original sin?</p>

<p>The Augustinian notion of <a href="http://suite101.com/article/augustine-original-sin-and-free-will-a171414">free will</a> is shown to be flawed when animals exibit similar behaviours to what the church has called &#8216;original sin&#8217; in Christian contexts.</p>

<h3>Why are Christians so down on women?</h3>

<blockquote><p>Woman is a temple built on a sewer &#8211;Tertulian</p></blockquote>

<p>Throughout Christian and Jewish tradition there has been the view that some women are to be idolized while some are to be reviled. Eve and Mary have always been seen as role models for Christian women, demure, motherly women focussed on their family.</p>

<p>In proverbs, lady Wisdom is compared to the painted whore.</p>

<p>In Jewish tradition, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Sira">Ben Sira</a> holds that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilith">Lilith</a> was the first wife of Adam, but would not submit to him before Eve was created from his rib.
For centuaries the Virgin Mary idolized in Catholic tradition, the perfect mother who is also chaste.
To some degree, protestant women try to copy this impossibility also, internalising the damaging stereotypes that sexually empowered women are wrong, filthy and dangerous.</p>

<p>Augustine penis - the idea of original sin being transmitted by semen is part of the condemnation of masturbation.
The view that erections are sinful leads to the view that women, not men need to regulate expression of their sexuality. That they must be meek to avoid leading the men into sin.</p>

<h3>Should women &#8216;submit&#8217; in marriage?</h3>

<blockquote><p>I can’t think of even one instance in 35 years of marriage where it has made any sense at all for Judy to obey or submit to my authority. The concept of female submission in marriage&#8230; made not the slightest difference to what was a strong and co-operative marriage relationship.</p><p>For the concept to have meaning there must surely be a significant number and frequency of examples where the wife submits and the husband exercises his authority&#8230; more often than not those sorts of actions [would] have undermined or created a challenge to marital happiness.</p><footer><strong>&#8220;Rev Dr Kieth Mascord&#8221;</strong> <cite><a href='http://arestlessfaith.com.au/blog/33/'>arestlessfaith.com.au/blog/33/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<h3>Is our church focussing on spiritual growth for believers?</h3>

<blockquote><p>Christian community without a personal, dynamic daily relationship with Jesus Christ built around hearing from God on a daily basis through the Bible is just not an effective means for spiritual growth.  That is why, when you take the Bible out of the mix, there is no difference between people from the Christian community and people from the secular community.</p><p>In fact, as this study shows, a Christian community that does not engage the Bible is often worse off.</p><footer><strong>Arnie Cole</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.gotandemblog.com/warning-study-finds-that-christian-communities-have-more-teen-pregnancies'>www.gotandemblog.com/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Gotandem - MTD and childish believers who don&#8217;t independantly read their bibles and pray 4 times a week are generally worse off than atheists.
A major risk of being in the church but not changed by scripture, or a relationship with Jesus, or letting the holy spirit do work is that Christians can become bitter and callous. Some people, while they have extensive knowledge of the bible, they don&#8217;t believe that they need to be changed by God though the Holy Spirit, instead choosing to interpret God&#8217;s word through their own understanding. <a href="http://www.gotandemblog.com/mean-christians">gotandem-mean-christians</a>&#8220;They get so used to doing the Holy Spirit’s work for Him that they start trying to be the Holy Spirit for other people too&#8221;.
In fact, studies have found higher rates of teenage pregnancy in states that have the higest rates of people that describe themselves as &#8220;very religious&#8221;
Cole warns that communities where Jesus is not shaping them are worse off than those that don&#8217;t nominally call themselves Christian. If some people are offended by this, maybe they need a wake up call that just calling yourself a Christian doesn&#8217;t make your life any better.</p>

<p>DIVORCE STATS!
And before evangelicals pull out the peackock feathers, it&#8217;s not just the liberal church that has this problem. In fact, in one study evangelicals had higher rates of divorce than mainline protestants, and far higher than atheists. It&#8217;s easy to blame other churches for the problem in perception of religion in Western countries.</p>

<p>Also high rates of pornography, smoking, adultery/pre-marital sex. Could be moralising principle, or it could be that the causal factor is that those who read their bibles are most strongly correlated with those who choose to believe, to the point that they stand up for their beliefs for themselves, and act on them.</p>

<p>Most disturbingly, higher rates of child abuse, possibly because the churches fail to root out the evil people that try to worm their way in (Jude 4)</p>

<p>In a 2009 talk at the Resurgence church, [rose][Matt Chandler recounted] his story of bringing a non-Christian woman with past relationship breakdown to a moralising church, and hearing one of the worst sermons in his life. The sermon was run of the mill moralising by an excessively conservative preacher, talking about how if someone lacks sexual purity, then they will be physically broken and drained.
Rather than preaching grace and forgiveness to the broken in love and gentleness, many preachers seek instead to instill fear and shame in the hearts of emotionally vulnerable audience concerned with their own self worth, as many young adults are.
* You can preach love and forgiveness
* You can preach with humility and gentleness
* You can welcome the outsiders into the church, preaching that we have all sinned and come from broken homes
* Or you can preach a message of shame and guilt, because <strong>that&#8217;s all you know</strong>.</p>

<p>Moralising doesn&#8217;t do what its fire and brimstone preachers think it will. Without calling the faithful to a transformative relationship of love, they can inspire only guilt, shame and disgust. But studies have shown that the human body will override disgust with sexual desire taking precedence. Those who feel guilt and shame about sexual missteps may be brought back to church by their guilt, for a time. But if the spirit is not working in their lives, ultimately many will leave, or be caught up in a cycle of perpetual sin. In fact, many people who many otherwise volunteer to work as missionaries may be held back by the idea that they are not worthy, that they are too sinful. Others simply don&#8217;t want to ask for forgiveness from God, or return to church, because of the fear that they are too far off and can never be forgiven.</p>

<p>To heal people will need the faithful to stop finger-pointing, stop blaming, stop the shrill preaching, and will need to start listening, directing, and calling people to repentance.</p>

<p>prevent wrongdoing, but can make people who are guilty and ashamed about their sexuality feel the need to go back to the same church to feel relieved from the guilt and shame.</p>

<p>Head knowledge but need to fuck. Not just have respect for being smarter.</p>

<h3>Why do Christians take all of the bible literally?</h3>

<p>&#8220;The secret to survivin&#8217; is knowin&#8217; what to throw away and knowing what to keep&#8221; &#8211; Kenny Rogers, the gambler</p>

<h3>Was Sodom and Gomorrah destroyed because of homosexuality?</h3>

<p>Many people think this, after a reading of Genesis 19. But they miss several key features. God has already decided to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah when he sends the angelic messengers, only relenting to send them to see if there are 10 richeous souls at the behest of Abraham in Genesis 18 (&#8220;Will you sweep away the godly along with the wicked?&#8221;).
a reading of this text within its narrative context, both immediate and broad, condemns not only the attempted rape but also the attempted homosexual act.</p>

<h3>Does leaving the church mean that someone has failed?</h3>

<p>&#8220;You got to know when to hold &#8216;em, know when to fold &#8216;em, know when to walk away and know when to run&#8221; &#8211; Kenny Rogers, the gambler</p>

<h3>Why do Christians do many of the things the Church teaches against</h3>

<p>Peacock feathers - assumption that we are never wrong
Cheating - never take pragmatic, problem solving approach.
Materialism - commonly the church preaches against people buying the latest phone, the lastest laptop and the latest tablet. But that doesn&#8217;t stop people who just bought the latest products from turning up to church to parade them around.</p>

<p>Christians lie all the time</p>

<p>Dawkins creationist video</p>

<p>Lack of moral cognition &amp; opposition to relativism and debate.</p>

<h3>Is there such a thing as objective morality?</h3>

<p>If there is, then why do democratic countries have legislative assemblies that can change laws and introduce new ones?
Secular laws better
Many Christians argue that atheists should read the bible because Australia&#8217;s system of laws was originally based on Judeo-Chrisian values.
If this is the case, the removal of homosexuality as a civil offence in the 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s shows the superiority of secular morality and its propensity to change with the times.</p>

<p>Marriage equality - needs to be understood in light of the secular world and the view of how scripture is to be read as morality for society today.

<blockquote><p>To reject the historicity or special creation of Adam and Eve calls into question the ability of God to clearly communicate with man and undermines the authority of Scripture&#8230; If Genesis 1–3 is not literal history, then Jesus died for a mythological problem and is therefore a mythological Savior offering us a mythological hope. The glorious gospel of Christ is at stake in this battle.</p><footer><strong>Retards in Genesis</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/2011/02/21/adam-and-orthodoxy'>www.answersingenesis.org/2011/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Adam as Israel</p>

<p>Israel’s history as a nation can be broken down as follows:
* Israel is “created” by God at the exodus through a cosmic battle (gods are defeated and the Red Sea is “divided”);
* The Israelites are given Canaan to inhabit, a lush land flowing with milk and honey;
* They remain in the land as long as they obey the Mosaic law;
* They persist in a pattern of disobedience and are exiled to Babylon.</p>

<p>Israel’s history parallels Adam’s drama in Genesis:
* Adam is created in Genesis 2 after the taming of chaos in Genesis 1;
* Adam is placed in a lush garden;
* Law (not to eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil) is given as a stipulation for remaining in the garden;
* Adam and Eve disobey and are exiled.</p>

<h3>Why can church feel lonely for some people?</h3>

<blockquote><p>The “new normal” is also dominated by unmarried young adults&#8230; The challenge for churches, in particular, is that they are not as effective in working with unmarried adults as they are with conventional married-plus-kids families. Why is that?</p><footer><strong>David Kinnaman</strong> <cite><a href='http://davidkinnaman.com/2011/david/the-new-normal-demographic-unmarried-twentysomethings/'>davidkinnaman.com/2011/david/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Women in the Anglican church can be [isolated and ignored for their singleness][anglican-singleness]</p>

<blockquote><p>I often feel like the freak no one wants to talk to at church…”
“[singles] feel invisible or unwanted because they are in the minority.”
“I don&#8217;t want to be left standing all by myself after church or have people walk away from me when I try and start a conversation with them.”
“It is so painfully lonely not fitting in and feeling socially worthless, particularly when you hear about all the social gatherings that go on, none of which you ever receive an invitation to. It is awful.”
“It is really hard to continue going to church when every week you know you will be left out after the meeting. It is painful watching friends greet each other and give out invites and be all happy and together.”
“I am looking for a little bit of love from my Christian community, but instead I feel like a leper… I never get invited anywhere.”
“People think that you must be busy Friday and Saturday nights, and the reality is, that you’re sitting at home in front of the TV…”
“I have not met any single person in their 30s who is not really hurting… Get to your mid 30s, when all your friends are married, the reality is that while your married friends&#8217; social network is rapidly expanding, the single persons&#8217; network is rapidly diminishing.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Often, well meaning Christians can be accidently hutful towards singles, asking condascending questions like &#8220;[tried-praying][Have you tried praying about it?]&#8221;
&#8220;If girls do get asked out they think, &#8216;We have to make this work. I might not get asked out for another 10 years.&#8217;&#8221; The &#8220;if&#8221; is big: Christian student after student in four states generalized to me: &#8220;Women don&#8217;t get asked out.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Is our church open to those that disagree?</h3>

<blockquote><p>He who busies himself with the sins of others, or judges his brother on suspicion, has not yet even begun to repent or to examine himself so as to discover his own sins, which are truly heavier than a great lump of lead; nor does he know why a man becomes heavyhearted when he loves vanity and chases after falsehood (cf. Ps. 4:2). That is why, like a fool who walks in darkness, he no longer attends to his own sins but lets his imagination dwell on the sins of others, whether these sins are real or merely the products of his own suspicious mind</p><footer><strong>&#8220;St Maximus the Confessor&#8221;</strong> <cite><a href='https://solzemli.wordpress.com/2011/04/16/saint-maximus-the-confessor-on-focusing-on-the-sins-of-others/'>solzemli.wordpress.com/2011/04/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>&#8220;the more exclusive the group, the more pretense is needed to establish and maintain the group, and thus the more self-righteous and immoral it becomes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h3>Can churches do better?</h3>

<blockquote><p>The fact that someone interprets the Bible differently than I do does not automatically mean that the person does not love or value the Bible as much as I. It doesn&#8217;t mean they are trying to hurt me, or hurt women, or hurt Christianity.</p><p>For constructive dialog to happen, Christians must stop conflating differences in interpretation of Scripture with differences in commitment to Scripture.  We must respond to one another’s questions, arguments, and ideas in kind, with more questions, arguments, and ideas, rather than avoiding the conversation altogether by dismissing one another as unfaithful.</p><footer><strong>Rachel Held Evans</strong> <cite><a href='http://rachelheldevans.com/bible-interpretation'>rachelheldevans.com/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>If there is something people don’t like about what you have said or done –bam! - out goes the actual Bible and they are telling you how awful of a person you are because they think the Bible is all about pointing out why other people need to be more like them.</p><footer><strong>Arnie Cole</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.gotandemblog.com/when-someone-throws-the-bible-at-you-it-feels-like-hell'>www.gotandemblog.com/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Rather than being defensive or dismissive, we should learn from critics, especially those young Christians who are expressing consternation about the state of faith in America. <br/>Jesus told us to expect hostility and negative reactions. That is certainly nothing new. But the issue is what we do with it. Is it a chance to defend yourself and demand your rights? Or is it an opportunity to show people grace and truth? Common ground is becoming more difficult to find between Christians and those outside the faith. When the Apostle Paul advises believers to &#8216;live wisely among those who are not Christians&#8217; and to &#8216;let your conversation be gracious and effective,&#8217; (Colossians 4:5-6, NLT) he could be writing no better advice to committed Christians [today].</p><footer><strong>David Kinnaman</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/16-teensnext-gen/94-a-new-generation-expresses-its-skepticism-and-frustration-with-christianity'>www.barna.org/barna-update/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>PEW
Rise of nones</p>

<p>Many figures show that a young generation is leaving the church like never before. When we hear of a brother or sister walking away from the faith a few things happen. Calvinists will insist that by double predestination, they never were true Christians. Arminians will assert that they could have experienced grace, but failed to continue to harden their heart. Still others will claim that they are just going through a &#8216;phase&#8217;, and that they&#8217;ll come back to church when they&#8217;re older, and less rebellious. The figures don&#8217;t bear this out, and in fact show the opposite happening - the bulk of movement is ex-believers leaving, not &#8216;prodigals&#8217; returning.</p>

<p>BBC
Kinnaman - Anti-homosexual percent</p>

<p>Gay marriage stats - straight
One of the biggest strides in the gay rights movement is in getting stright people with gay friends or family members to be more comfortable with them, and to more openly discuss thi issue of same-sex relationships. This has been reflected in figures of the numbers of people who support same-sex marriages or civil unions. While biologically the number of people with same-sex attraction may only be 4-8%
SSA figures !!!
, the number of people in Australia supporting gay marriage has gone up,
GAY Marriage figures
Meaning that people who identify as gay probably have ~5 close friends or family members that care about gay rights. Some of these people are religious.</p>

<p>Consider this, if you had a gay uncle, or a lesbian cousin, or, some day, a lesbian daughter, would you let their same-sex partner come to birthday gatherings? Why or why not?
Would it confuse children?
CARM</p>

<p>More than 6-in-10 Americans believe that negative messages from America’s places of worship contribute either a lot (23%) or a little (40%) to higher rates of suicide among gay and lesbian youth.
Nearly seven-in-ten (69%) Millennials agree that religious groups are alienating young people by being too judgmental about gay and lesbian issues.</p>

<p>TWO - Archbishop N Twin Cities
eternal salvation at stake based on having a &#8216;conversation of heart&#8217; with her son over opposition to homosexuality.</p>

<p>Marriage equality, and the church&#8217;s approach to homosexuality has lead to an intensification of the view that evangelical Christianity is not compatible with modern society that respects tolerance and liberalism. In some ways, this will always happen with Christians being &#8220;in the world but not of the world&#8221;, in others, it can be a barrier to attending church.</p>

<p>. Some who had previously said &#8216;well I guess I&#8217;m a Christian&#8217; will now respond &#8220;I guess I&#8217;m no religion&#8221;. To some degree, the loss of affiliation of these nominally Christian people is not a disaster.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to claim that this is a problem of sin - that people don&#8217;t have a big enough picture of the cost of grace. But it&#8217;s worth asking the question - are some resorting to moralising when they should be inviting the unsaved to be freed by grace through a relationship with Jesus?</p>

<p>Is there a &#8216;freak&#8217; in our church who we try to tolerate but
Do people who don&#8217;t conveniently fit into our labels get treated like a church &#8216;freak&#8217;?</p>

<p>Are we being too hard on homosexuals, making them out to be the scapegoats of secularism and the sexual revolution? Does the desire of evangelicals to &#8216;hold fast&#8217; to teaching risk ostracising those who have genuine concerns?</p>

<p>Is there a tendancy for Christians to preach when they should be listening? To ask with snide condascention &#8216;have you tried praying&#8217; to people who feel they are <em>dying on the inside</em>? To offer unsatisfying answers to questions long time believers have wrestled with?</p>

<p>Are some guilty of hearing that a friend has a concern or question that lacks an easy answer, that they cease to be seen as a person who can be talked to, but they become a label of &#8216;that person&#8217;. Are people afraid to ask questions because they fear being &#8216;that person&#8217;, a problem, a prayer request?</p>

<p>Rachel, the &#8216;girl who believes in evolution&#8217;. We&#8217;ll pray for her. Has she tried praying about it?</p>

<p>Some people will always have easy answers. But brothers and sisters, when you hear about believers leaving the church, I hope that you will have the humility, the patience and the integrity to be ready to listen, not judge, to seek to understand over being understood, to pardon rather than condemn, and to be ready to ask hard questions.</p>
