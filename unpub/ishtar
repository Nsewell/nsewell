The Babylonains worshipped a range of gods and goddesses, including the fertility goddess Ishtar. Ishtar, later called Ianna announces herself as the "Queen of Heaven"

In a later version of this poem, the goddess's name has changed to Ianna, but her sister is still Ereshkigal, "the queen of the underworld". She announces herself to the doorkeeper "I am Inanna, Queen of Heaven".

Ishtar 
> 85 "Ištar has gone down to the netherworld, she has not come up.
> 86 From the moment that Ištar went down to the netherworld,
> 87 the bull will not mount the cow, the ass will not impregnate the jenny,
> 88 the young man will not impregnate the girl in the thoroughfare 
> 89 The young man sleeps in his be[dr]oom,
> 90 the young woman sleeps by [her] sel[f].
> 91 Ea, in his wise heart, conceived a plan:
> 92 he created Aṣûšu-namir, an assinnu. ((The word assinnu denotes a male cultic prostitute))

The separation of Ishtar, the queen of heaven, from her natural place then in the Babylonian religion, the sexual function of humans is damaged.

> 26 "Here is your sister Ištar at [your gate],
> 27 she who holds the great play-ropes, who roils up the deep before Ea the king".  
> 28 When Ereškigal heard this, 
> 29 her face went pale as a freshly cut tamarisk, 
> 30 her lips went dark as the rim of a vat.  
> 31 "Why did she set her heart on me? Why would her mood lighten mine?  
> 32 Here now, shall I drink water with the Anunnaki-gods, 
> 33 Shall I eat a loaf of clay for bread, shall I drink dirty water for beer?
> 34 "Shall I weep for the young men who have left (their) helpmeets?  
> 35 Shall I weep for the young women who are wrenched from their lovers' loins?  
> 36 Shall I weep for the helpless infant who was taken before his time?
