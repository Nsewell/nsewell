<div class="entry-content"><h3>The age of the earth can only be determined by eyewitness testimony</h3>

<p>On the 21st of November, <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/fischer-only-eyewitness-testimony-can-determine-age-earth">this moron from Answers in Genesis got on Bryan Fisher&#8217;s radio program</a> to insist that &#8220;science cannot tell us the age of the earth, the only way we can know the age of the earth is if we have eyewitness testomony from somebody who was there.&#8221; As Fisher correctly points out though, Adam wasn&#8217;t around before his creation so he can&#8217;t know the age of the earth.

<p>2 Peter 3:8 says &#8220;A single day is like a thousand years with the Lord and a thousand years are like a single day&#8221;. So really, people have no idea the age of the earth, even with the number of days literally described in Genesis.</p>

<h3>Girls should sign virginity pledges to their fathers</h3>

<p>Virginity pledges are a dumb unChristian idea that leeches off genuine concern for girls growing up in a sex saturated culture. The <a href="http://biblicalpersonhood.wordpress.com/2012/01/21/whats-wrong-with-purity-balls-one-virgins-perspective/">pledges go like this</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>I (Daughter’s Name)’s Father, choose before to God to war for my daughter’s purity. I acknowledge myself as the authority and protector of my daughter’s virginity, and pledge to be a man of integrity as I lead, guide, and pray over my daughter and her virginity – as the <strong>High Priest</strong> of my home.</p></blockquote>

<p>And for Virgins:</p>

<blockquote><p>I (Name) pledge my purity to my father, my future/husband and my Creator. I recognize that virginity is my most precious gift to offer to my future husband. I will not engage in sexual activity of any kind before marriage but will keep my thought and my body pure as a very special present for the one I marry.</p></blockquote>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of problems with these. Firstly, pledges are completely unbiblical:</p>

<blockquote><p>Matt 5:34-37  But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God’s throne:  Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.</p>

<p>James 5:12  But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.</p></blockquote>

<p>It should also immediately stand out to any believer, the only true High Priest in the New Testament it Jesus (Heb 2:17, Heb 3:1, Heb 4:14-15). But many patriarchal leaders <a href="http://kbonikowsky.wordpress.com/2011/03/24/women-in-the-text-do-women-need-another-priest/">don&#8217;t really care if what they are doing is biblical</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Bible teaches that all believers are part of a “royal priesthood” (1 Pet. 2:9), and that there is no intermediary between man and God except for the man Christ Jesus (1 Tim. 2:5). Still, if a man aspires to be a godly husband, he will assume responsibility to oversee the spiritual condition of his wife.</p></blockquote>

<p>Let me paraphrase to see if I&#8217;ve understood; all believers are equal in the priesthood except for the women, they are too stupid to be priests without a huband supplementing the relationship with Jesus as a stand in &#8220;high priest&#8221;. Becaus that was the way Rib woman and Dust man worked, holy spirit be damned.</p>

<p>Furthermore,</p>

<p>Also, none of this works. With abstinence only sex education pushing for virginity pledges, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470641/">53% of adolescents retract their pledge within a year</a>.</p>

<h3>Girls should wear dumb clothes</h3>

<p>Bikini modesty
shirt two sizes too big</p>

<h3>A girl should bend down in front of her grandfather and ask him if he can see her panties</h3>

<h3>Women should submit</h3>

<blockquote><p>I can’t think of even one instance in 35 years of marriage where it has made any sense at all for Judy to obey or submit to my authority. The concept of female submission in marriage&#8230; made not the slightest difference to what was a strong and co-operative marriage relationship.</p><p>For the concept to have meaning there must surely be a significant number and frequency of examples where the wife submits and the husband exercises his authority&#8230; more often than not those sorts of actions [would] have undermined or created a challenge to marital happiness.</p><footer><strong>&#8220;Rev Dr Kieth Mascord&#8221;</strong> <cite><a href='http://arestlessfaith.com.au/blog/33/'>arestlessfaith.com.au/blog/33/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>

<h3>You should always listen to your pastor</h3>

<h3>The 10 commandments are the foundation of human morality</h3>

<p><img src="moses-jamroll.jpg" alt="Moses with Jam rolls" />
What if God didn&#8217;t give people the 10 commandments, but two jam rolls? Would everyone be murdering each other today?</p>

<p>In fact, if you could re-write the 10 commandments, would you make any changes?
Maybe you&#8217;d take out the part about the sabbath, since no Chrisitan follows it today.
Would you remove the part about how a wife is property. It&#8217;s pointless when the adultery commandment is there.
Plus I&#8217;d probably put in a commandment on slavery, so that people don&#8217;t mistake that <a href="http://www.lva.virginia.gov/lib-edu/education/psd/nation/halifax.htm">God supports it</a>.</p>

<h3>Cohabitation before marriage makes you more likely to divorce</h3>

<p>An <a href="http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1959/family-meals-cohabitation-divorce-new-findings-contradict-conventional-wisdom">article from Pew Research in April 8, 2011</a> disputes the idea that cohabitation before marriage leads to divorce:</p>

<blockquote><p>On the topic of cohabitation, everybody knows that couples who live together before marriage are more likely to divorce than couples who do not, because that is what much research has found. But some recent work disputes that conclusion. Now that most couples move in together before they marry, cohabitation may not be as linked to divorce as it was when live-in couples were less common.</p></p>

<p>The Pew Research Center <a href="http://pewsocialtrends.org/2010/11/18/the-decline-of-marriage-and-rise-of-new-families/2/">report on families</a>, released last year, found that 44% of adults (and more than half of 30- to 49-year-olds) say they have cohabited at some point. Nearly two-thirds of adults who ever cohabited (64%) say they thought about it as a step toward marriage. The report also notes a trend toward rising public acceptance of cohabiting couples over the years. Most Americans now say the rise in unmarried couples living together either makes no difference to society (46%) or is good for society (9%).</p>

<p>A <a href="http://paa2011.princeton.edu/download.aspx?submissionId=112067">paper by Bowling Green State University researchers</a>, using data from the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg.htm">National Survey of Family Growth</a>, concluded that among women who married since the mid-1990s, cohabitation is not tied to heightened risk of divorce. Looking at women who married in the past 15 years, &#8220;our work shows that cohabitation no longer influences marital instability,&#8221; wrote researchers Wendy D. Manning and Jessica A. Cohen in the paper they presented at the population meeting.</p></blockquote>

<p>Also, in Australia, <a href="http://www.aifs.gov.au/institute/pubs/factssheets/fs2010conf/fs2010conf.html">78% of couples who marry have lived together beforehand in 2008</a>, rising from <a href="http://www.aifs.gov.au/institute/info/charts/marriage/cohabit.html">16% in 1975</a>.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.aifs.gov.au/institute/pubs/fm2003/fm65/dev2.pdf" title="Premarital cohabitation and subsequent marital stability">2003 study &#8220;Premarital cohabitation and subsequent marital stability&#8221; by the Australian Institute of Family Studies</a> found:</p>

<blockquote><p>The old finding that marriages of those who lived
together before marrying were at a greater risk of breakdown was also partly attributable to the way in which
marriage duration has been measured. We believe that, in
the interests of comparing like with like, separation risk
should be measured after set periods of the union rather
than after set periods of marriage.</p>

<p>The differences in measured outcomes for those from direct and
indirect marriages appear to be entirely attributable to
other factors.</p>

<p>So far, the evidence suggests that premarital cohabitation has little impact one way or the other [on the chances of any subsequent marriage surviving].</p></blockquote>

<h3>Masturbation can make you gay</h3>

<h3>God is able to cure cancer</h3>

<h3>God cares about US politics</h3>

<p>Some Christians seem to think that if a Democrat is in the White House then God will necessarily allow <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/letter-from-2012-in-obamas-america-dobson/">Russia to launch a nuclear attack on Israel</a>. Talk about American exceptionalism. Many in the far right insist that America was founded on Christian values, and will be blessed by God in the same way the Israelites were blessed.</p>

<p>The misinformed view that America is founded on Christian values is often dangerously confused with the biblical narrative of the Israelites being blessed and cursed by God for their conduct.</p>

<p>Deuteronomy 7:6-9 establishes that the Israelites were not great in number, but God makes promises to a small nation. They were to follow God&#8217;s commands to reap the rewards of the promises.</p>

<p>God does not promise anything to America, not focussing on any one people group but giving a gospel to all.</p>

<p>&#8220;For you are a holy people to the LORD your God; the LORD your God has chosen you to be a people for Himself, a special treasure above all the peoples on the face of the earth. The LORD did not set His love on you nor choose you because you were more in number than any other people, for you were the least of all peoples; but because the LORD loves you, and because He would keep the oath which He swore to your fathers, the LORD has brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you from the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Therefore know that the LORD your God, He is God, the faithful God who keeps covenant and mercy for a thousand generations with those who love Him and keep His commandments&#8221; (Deuteronomy 7:6-9).</p>

<p>There wasn&#8217;t anything particular about the Israelites which caused God to pick them as His chosen people. A big part of the reason they were pick was because God made a promise to Abraham and He keeps His promises.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not think in your heart, after the LORD your God has cast them out before you, saying, &#8216;Because of my righteousness the LORD has brought me in to possess this land&#8217;; but it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD is driving them out from before you. It is not because of your righteousness or the uprightness of your heart that you go in to possess their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations that the LORD your God drives them out from before you, and that He may fulfill the word which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob&#8221; (Deuteronomy 9:4-5).</p>

<p>Watch these losers pray desperately that Obama would lose the presidency, and God would inspire &#8216;millions&#8217; to oppose gay marriage (ammendments passed in 3 states):</p>

Here&#8217;s what their basic claim is, that the Holy Spirit has revealed to them that in the year 2001, we entered into the second apostolic age… What does that mean?&#8230; that the Holy Spirit has given the power of prophecy and the power and authority of an apostle to certain people in this generation of the church since 2001.</p>

<p>It seems very odd to me that the Holy Spirit would give that to people whose theology is unbiblical and totally aberrant.</p>

<p>Christians may and should pray for their country and for their political leaders. Christians should not, however, seek to save a nation. Unfortunately, it is the salvation of a country that seems to be the driving force behind today’s patriotic idolatry. While there certainly is nothing wrong with acknowledging and lamenting the moral degeneration and depravity of this country, believers must recognize that America never was a “Christian nation.” Yes, America’s founders may have heeded a form of biblical morality and engraved some Bible verses onto their monuments, but America never was and never will be in covenant with God. She is not chosen by Him as was Israel. She has been blessed by the Creator, but in the end, she will fall like the rest.</p>

<p>It is not the job of the Church to save America—or any country—from its decline. The purpose of the Church is to proclaim repentance and faith in Christ alone for salvation, desiring to see individual hearts changed through the preaching and power of the Gospel. Whether that is done in a Romans 1 country or not is irrelevant. Contrary to the many urgent calls that are heard today for America to “return to God,” the Almighty does not need a “reformed” America to accomplish His purposes. In fact, it could be argued that His work would actually be furthered by the downfall of this once-great nation. When the false god that is America finally falls, perhaps many will repent of their patriotic idolatry and truly turn to the One Who saves, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a bitter person, in fact I&#8217;ve gotten a lot of <a href="http://christiannymphos.org/2009/07/09/cunnilingus-101/">good quality advice from Christians</a> over the years.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m just a little sick of the bullshit.</p>
