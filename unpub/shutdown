The 2013 Values Voter Summit was where irony went to hi-five itself, given the two things today’s Republican Party lacks: values and voters. The annual summit is the Christian Right’s quest to identify its standard-bearer and presumptive nominee for 2016. If you’ve read the transcripts, you will know how far from the mainstream the Republican Party’s leaders and its base are from the attitudes held by a majority of Americans.

Rand Paul chose not to talk about today’s pressing economic issues, and instead talked about a religious crusade. The Senator from Kentucky opened with, “From Boston to Zanzibar, there is a worldwide war on Christianity.” The spiritual leader of the Tea Party and Heritage Foundation CEO, Jim DeMint, said, “Gay marriage is unconstitutional,” and questioned the validity of the Separation of Church and State. Rick Santorum called Obamacare’s contraception mandate “a descendent of the French revolution.” Michele Bachmann linked the government shutdown to Benghazi. Allen West tied secular humanism to high murder rates. Mike Huckabee said America will “answer to God for abandoning the nation of Israel.” Ted Cruz said, “The Obama administration is determined to violate every one of our Christian rights.” Ultimately, these were the saner remarks. Conservative columnist Star Parker said, “Liberals are enemies of God, and are at war with the American people.”
