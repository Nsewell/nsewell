Mohler "men are tempted to give themselves to pornography, women are tempted to commit pornography"
If you're a woman, you don't have to pose for a picture or star in a pornographic movie to commit pornography. When you dress and behave in a way that is designed primarily to arouse sexual desire in men, you're committing pornography with your life.
"I believe that the root of women's struggle with lust is that we want to dominate men, control them and manipulate them through sexual appeal"

p91
When you wear cloting that accentuates, draws attention to, or highligts the feminine parts of your body, it's like wearing a flashing neon sign pointing to the very thing he's trying not to be consumed with.

p103
Even if it were possible to masturbate without lust, I think a lifestyle of masturbation is based on a wrong understanding of God's plan for sex
