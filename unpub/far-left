A Newsnight interview between Jeremy Paxman and Russel Brand has received [almost 8 million hits](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YR4CseY9pk) with political progressives sharing the video on social media. Brand has a history as a progressive commentator of trying to draw attention to issues like the growing economic disparity in the United States, and has always been critical of the media's fixation on celebrity and pop while ignoring difficult issues like war and drone strikes. Brand articulated a clear citicism of News Limited in [a previous Paxman interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYM7SzJMKns), but unfortunately he frequently resorts to generalisations about the media, the BÃªte noire of the Occupy movement. Unfortunately in the latest interview, Paxton's questioning of the effectiveness of far left movements has triggered progressives to validate Brand's claim of media bias rather than critically examine the means by which radical movements operate.

Recently I was looking for information on the US right, and came across the excellent blog of [Chris Berlet](http://chipberlet.blogspot.com.au), a civil rights campaigner researching political movements. A very poinant article on the [failure of far left movements due to sectarian divisions](http://chipberlet.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/abstaining-from-bad-sects.html) stood out as relevant to the issues I see with progressives today. He eloquently criticises the radical forces that, in my opinion, have sabotaged protest movements in Sydney:

> Ultra-leftism is an egocentric form of mythopoetic martyrdom whereby practitioners anoint themselves as the beleaguered guardians of the one true political line. They read long impenetrable manifestos at public meetings. They show up at mass demonstrations with helmets and hockey sticks for a game of self-fulfilling prophecy that often results in violence as they hurl themselves at police. They inevitably urge a course of action that is hopelessly out of touch with reality. Even Lenin called this an "infantile disorder."

> Cadre organizations resemble **sects** in terms of internal organization and hierarchy, but not all cadre organizations or their members are **sectarian** in organizational practice. Not all cadre organizations engage in ultra-leftist activities. Some cadre members of ultra-left groups can still act appropriately as individuals in mass organizations.

Berlet goes on to quote Andrew Feenberg in **[Paths To Failure: The Dialectics of Organization and Ideology in the New Left](http://www.sfu.ca/~andrewf/nl.htm)** explaining how ultra-leftist organisations can create a false sense of achievement. Looking at the New Left of the 1960s and early 1970s, Feenberg, argues the attraction of "sectarianism and ultra-leftism sustained its energies for several decisive years while dispersing its audience."

> "Sectarianism in the movement was based on a sense of moral superiority that was effective in motivating an in-group but incompatible with its expansion among those sympathetic to its program. Moral heroism mobilized the troops, but it was accompanied by a characteristic romantic elitism rooted in a sense of differentness, of sacrifice and oppression."

> "New left sectarianism was often conjoined to ultra-leftism, the systematic failure to employ strategies realistically adapted to the situation at hand. Instead, many new left groups preferred to substitute individual morality for politics and became obsessively concerned with establishing the revolutionary personal identity of their members at the expense of effective action on the real world. Ultra-leftists became adept at driving a wedge between principle and practice in every kind of situation, blocking the employment of even the most elementary instrumental intelligence in political work."

I would argue that Brand's recommendation not to vote is deeply counterproductive, as it risks radicals buying into the false sense of accomplishment that these movements offer. The observation that social democratic parties are unable to effect change is apt in European countries facing debt crises where governments can do little but cut spending and raise taxes. But the defeatist narrative ignores the progress that social democratic reformers have achieved in public education and healthcare over the last 40 years. Worse, it risks alienating young voters from the political system, consigning issues like university spending cuts to have the smallest impact at the ballot box when otherwise the demographic could control the balance of power. 


This all reminds me of the kind of populist anti-populism so wonderfully satirised in [The Young Ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaPrc94sUO8):
