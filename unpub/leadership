Learned Leader or Natural Leader?

Is all leadership innate and natural? Is leadership limited to a spiritual gift? Or is it possible that leadership can be learned? This is a controversial subject, but I am of the strong opinion that you can learn leadership. I have watched far too many people who don’t fit the typical leadership image emerge from the fray and assume substantial responsibility and carry it well. Not as a manager, but as a leader - someone who has true influence and leverages it toward a clear and compelling preferred future.

So what about this person who emerges? Was there latent ability and capacity not yet tapped? Or were skills learned that enabled this person to literally function at a different level - a leadership level? Can someone actually begin to see life from a different perspective, the perspective of a leader? Or is this reserved for the few, the chosen and the elite - those born with something special? Again, I believe you can learn leadership.
I acknowledge that different levels of natural ability in things such as I.Q., discipline, charisma, drive and personal energy play a major role. Some leaders are greater than others. This is clear. But that’s not the question. The topic of this two part series is whether or not you are a learned or natural leader, and how to make the most of the profile that seems to fit you best. In part one, we’ll deal with the learned leader.

### The Learned Leader
#### Characteristics
• Learned leaders have followers.
This is the most basic characteristic that separates leaders (learned or natural) from non-leaders. The requirement here is that people follow you because they want to, not because of your title. You probably have a title, that’s fine, but (hopefully) that’s not why people follow you.
At this most basic level the issue is not how many followers you have. It doesn’t matter if you have five or fifteen or fifty or five hundred followers. The essential element is that people respond to your personal influence and follow your lead voluntarily. Non-leaders don’t have followers. They may have helpers for a task, but that’s not the same. Someone helping solely because of the task at hand, without engagement or response to you personally is not about leadership. That is project oriented management. Again, personal influence is essential.

• Learned leaders must think leadership before doing leadership.
Because leadership doesn’t come instinctively for a learned leader, you must intentionally think leadership to remain engaged and effective as a leader. It’s kind of like a golfer with a “natural swing” versus someone who needed to take lots of lessons to get his or her basic swing down. There is quite the list of components to a good swing, truly a lot to remember. At first trying to get all the parts of a golf swing to work together feels very awkward. But once you get it, and if you keep practicing, over the course of time your swing can become “natural.”

• Learned leaders are not inwardly compelled to lead.
This point will bring quick clarity to many of you. Here’s how it works. If you are a learned leader and you walk into a room where there is a leader who is engaged, in charge, and things are working well, you will feel no real need or compulsion to take over. You will help if needed. You will probably quickly see how you can be helpful, but you have no inner need or drive to take over. (In part two, you will see this is very different for the natural leader.)
If, however, you walk into a room where there is no leadership, (there may be a leader, but there is no leadership) and the environment is unproductive, unorganized, and the general “spirit” of the place is poor, you will rise up and do something about it. Depending on your personality, skill level, and the occasion, you may do something yourself, (take over) or you may leverage your influence to get the right people doing the right things. But you will do something to get things headed in the right direction.

• Learned leaders are industrious and take initiative.
If you are a learned leader you are likely to be a highly productive person, and you naturally migrate toward other productive people. In fact, you can be short on patience with people who even remotely appear “flaky” to you. You thrive on seeing things of value accomplished and you are quick to take initiative to get things started. Seeing things stall out drives you nuts. Your work ethic is strong and you enjoy a full schedule.

• Learned leaders seek results more than influence.
This is subtle and can morph over time as you gain more experience as a leader. In the earlier stages you were probably more interested in getting the job done rather than developing your influence with people. It’s faster and more direct. And you like accomplishing things. This is natural for a learned leader. Natural leaders want to get things done too, in fact, they are driven about results, but they are more interested in increasing their influence with people and getting things done through people than merely accomplishing the task at hand. This is one of the key competencies for a learned leader to grow toward.

Strengths

• Passion and discipline
Passion and discipline are not exclusive to the learned leader but are always in the strength mix among leaders in this profile. They are driven, full of life, and purposeful. Personal discipline is often the strength that enables a learned leader to keep up with natural leaders and, on occasion, surpass them. I don’t mean for this to sound like a competition, but merely to demonstrate the huge potential growth opportunity for learned leaders.

• Getting the job done
Learned leaders are generally fantastic at getting things done. The slight orientation toward projects and measurable goals is typically the origin of this trait. As the learned leader continues to develop, and his or her people side begins to flourish, the combination of projects and people becomes powerful, and even more productive.

• Can mentor and teach leadership well
The learned leader is a great leadership coach for one simple reason. He or she had to learn leadership themselves. This enables them to be good mentors and teachers of leadership to both learned and natural leaders.

#### Challenges

• Confidence
Because, at least in the early stages, leadership is not an instinctive behavior confidence is often a struggle for the learned leader. If you are a learned leader you may be unsure of yourself and will therefore second guess your thoughts and direction in general. With experience, confidence can build over time and will enable you to lead with greater inner conviction as well as gain greater ability to inspire others.

• Decisiveness
Difficulty in making tough decisions is largely an outcome of a lack in confidence. This is not about intelligence. Learned leaders are typically very smart. It’s more about a lack of certainty about what you want and your relative lack of certainty of knowing the right thing to do. Others opinions matter too much. Decisiveness, like confidence comes with practice and experience. Jump in, think it through, make a decision and take action. Do this over and over and you will begin to notice huge improvement.

• Casting a compelling vision
The challenge is not about knowing and understanding the vision. The challenge for the learned leader is selling the vision. Because learned leaders are still gaining confidence in themselves they don’t yet have the leadership persona needed to win others to the vision. If that is also coupled with underdeveloped people skills, getting people to follow your vision is difficult.
Let me encourage you. All this is doable, just not overnight. Focus on your own confidence first. Win self-leadership before leading others. Know what you want, why you want it, and at least partially how you will get there. Then lead. You don’t have to have all the details, but you must believe in yourself and what you want to accomplish before others will follow.

#### Key Concept

• Stretching
If you are a learned leader you will always be digging, learning and growing. This is essential to your leadership success. Coasting is not an option. It is natural and a good thing for you as a learned leader to feel just a little over your head. Most leaders are! Call it humility or call it wisdom, call it what you will but as a learned leader you will thrive if you stay focused and diligent as a great student of leadership.

#### Application

• Consistent leadership exposure
Learned leaders must have continual input of leadership development. From good leadership books to good leadership conferences this is a must. Exposure to good leaders is essential. Serving in an environment that is proactive about leadership development goes a long way toward your success.

• Take the reigns of leadership
Simply put. Lead. Don’t hold back. Ask forgiveness, not permission. It’s good to make mistakes, lots of them and even big ones. Just don’t make the same mistake twice. That indicates you are not paying attention and not learning. Write your plan, pick up the phone, call a meeting… do what it takes to get things moving!

• Trust your intuition
Your instincts, though not of a natural leader, are better than you think. They are probably not as fast as you would like them to be, nor are you as confident as you would like, but you must learn to read and trust your gut. Don’t worry so much about what others think. Know what you think and go for it.

• Increase personal influence over personal productivity
At first this will seem counterintuitive to a learned leader who wants to be effective. But over the long haul this will begin to make sense. No one ever leads a project, they lead people. If you gain personal leadership influence, people will follow and get the work done. Your work becomes about recruiting, inspiring, training, coaching and encouraging. The people are more talented than you may think. Trust yourself and trust them. You’ll be amazed at what can be accomplished.

### The Natural Leader
From time to time I meet someone and think, "Now there's a natural leader." They have a certain something about them that makes them stand out. This is not about a flashy personality, but more so a conviction of soul that is unwavering. It's more about a sharpness and quickness that puts them a step ahead of the pack. When this is combined with evidence of a track record of vision and accomplishment, the natural leader truly begins to rise above the norm.

But what makes them a natural leader? What does that mean and how does that matter? The curious thing about natural leaders is that some leverage their influence for significant and meaningful ministry and others flame out. Character matters.
Last month we posted Part 1 of this two part article which focused on Learned Leaders. Allow me to repeat one paragraph to refresh the context.

Is all leadership innate and natural? Is leadership limited to a spiritual gift? Or is it possible that leadership can be learned? This is a controversial subject, but I am of the strong opinion that you can learn leadership. I have watched far too many people who don't fit the typical leadership image emerge from the fray and assume substantial responsibility and carry it well. Not as a manager, but as a leader - someone who has true influence and leverages it toward a clear and compelling preferred future.

In this article, I will address the profile of a Natural Leader. I urge you to study these two articles side by side because the real insights do not show up in independent readings, but in comparison and contrast of the Learned Leader and the Natural leader.

#### Characteristics

• Natural leaders lead easily.
I won't say it's like riding a bicycle, but its close. Leading is so innate and instinctive that it's almost automatic. If you are a natural leader, it's just what you do. When you were young you may have been seen as a "problem kid". You weren't. You were a leader in the making. Or perhaps as a young adult you were the one who saw things a different way, often interpreted as "your way." These are often signs of an emerging leader. Regardless of your age and stage as a leader, the key is what you do with these natural instincts. Do you leverage them to get what you want or to help others? Can you submit to other more seasoned leaders or are you prideful and insist on doing it all your way? Having followers and leading easily is only the beginning, it’s what you choose to do with that ability over the course of a lifetime that matters.

• Natural leaders possess undeniable vision.
Candidly, I've never found an exception to this characteristic. Sometimes the vision isn't completely clear, sometimes there is no written plan to achieve the vision, but the vision is present and there is passion to achieve it.
I have talked with many pastors who are "between" visions... sort of. It's typically more about the partial death of a vision and a transition to another church than truly the lack of a vision. But it may feel that way. This is especially true if the pastor was wounded in one way or another.
So, this is the great divide. This is the characteristic that separates, to a large degree, learned leaders from natural leaders. So, how about you? Do you have a vision? Is it known and embraced by others? Are you passionate about fulfilling that vision? If so, you've passed the first gate... keep reading.

• Natural leaders are idea factories.
The formation of ideas has a potential upside and downside. The upside is that you are creative, solution oriented and have lots of ideas. They are not all good, but you have so many you are bound to hit gold sooner or later! The downside is that because you have so many ideas, you may bounce around in direction and therefore none of the ideas get enough attention to develop and make a difference.
Tagging on to the previous characteristic, it's kind of like the "vision of the week." You get so excited about something you read, or that you heard at a conference, or that you thought up yourself that you just "gotta" do it. The idea generation is good, the enthusiasm is great, but the lack of ability to "pick it and stick it" will kill you in time.

• Natural leaders have a strong ego.
This refers to the healthy ego strength that is necessary to accomplish any worthwhile vision. This is not about a self-absorbed and narcissistic approach to life and leadership.
It's important that you know yourself, love yourself, and enjoy being you. It's important that you have a sense of your gifts being fruitful and productive. Yet at the same time, you fully grasp your utter dependence upon God in such a way that reminds you it was He that gave you all your gifts and abilities. On your own you can do nothing that lasts or matters. It's important that you know that God is the One who granted you the vision that is within you.

• Natural leaders need to lead.
In contrast to the learned leader who doesn't "need" to lead, you do. In part one I stated that if a learned leader walks into a room where there is a leader who is engaged, in charge, and things are working well, he or she will feel no real compulsion to take over. This is very different for the natural leader. Natural leaders just can't help themselves. They walk in and always see how they could do it better. It's not necessarily arrogance. It's more about wiring. Natural leaders naturally assess. It can sound arrogant or critical, but at the heart of any leader is the desire to make things better. It's about progress, it’s about improving things... thus vision. If you as a natural leader assess yourself as a better leader than the one in the room (for good or bad, this is often the case) it is difficult for you to remain in the room and do nothing. The irony is that the leader is often doing a good job. The issue is that you would do it differently. If this is you, take hope, it does get better with maturity. In time you begin to realize that God can actually run a few things well without you!

#### Strengths

• Confidence
Confidence comes with the territory for natural leaders. There are times when fear creeps in, but overall you are confident in yourself and your abilities. It is also common that when you make a mistake that you get over it quickly, rebound and move on. People not only notice your confidence but draw from it personally.

• Communication
This is not about "preaching" abilities, though you may be a gifted preacher. This is more about leading from the platform and interpersonal communication in one to one and in small groups settings. Natural leaders do not struggle with making their thoughts known and clear. Words are easy for you and people not only understand you but seem to enjoy listening to what you have to say.

• Natural intuition
Natural leaders have a natural sense of intuition. You may find it hard to explain to others but like a seasoned cop on the streets, you know stuff in your gut, just because you know. You can't always give a reason, but you know. You sense it and you sense it first. You make a decision, take action and things go well because of your action. There are checks and balances here. You need to be right much more than wrong. Sorry, but intuition isn't of value if you are wrong more times than you are right!

#### Challenges

• Distractions
You may be smart, creative and fast, but the inability to focus will cost you dearly as a leader. Natural leaders like new stuff. They migrate toward the latest trend, best practices, and coolest technology. That's all good as long as you don't try to mix it all up in one local church pot. That makes a mess.
More importantly is the temptation to succumb to internal distractions. By internal distractions I mean the need to continually conquer new territory, when you haven't yet fully conquered the territory God has given you. Frankly, though the load of the church is heavy, it moves slowly. You may get bored and tempted to do other things to an extent that your first love and responsibility suffers. Speaking events, writing books, consulting, starting new ministry ventures, launching your own conference or being highly leveraged in your personal endeavors are good things in and of themselves. But they can also be huge distractions to what you are called to do. Sometimes even networking can become a distraction. Meeting people just to meet people. Yes, its fun, we love people. But stay on purpose.

• Cutting corners
This can get the best of natural leaders. Because you are often the smartest and fastest "been there done that" kid on the block, you may be tempted to show up unprepared - simply because you can. You may be tempted to do less that your best. You can get away with this for awhile, sometimes for a long while, but eventually it will catch up with you. Good leaders never quit digging in, learning, preparing and growing.

• Humility
Pride is often the unwanted companion that comes with confidence. I said that a healthy ego is a good thing, and it is. But left to its own path, it can get out of control. Jim Collins talks about how tough it is for strong leaders to "subjugate their egos" and allow true humility to shine through. But without that, you never realize the "level five" leadership he writes about in Good to Great. More importantly, pride breaks fellowship with God. Conquering a zealous ego is tough, but it's a must for your natural leadership to find its highest and most long term effectiveness.

#### Key Concept

• Strategic
The summary of strengths and challenges leads to the concept of leading strategically as the essential path to your maximum effectiveness. Strategic is not about being boring, monotonous, predictable, and over-structured. Strategic is being on purpose and staying on purpose. Leading strategically involves knowing where you are going, why you are going there, and how you will get there. Strategy is feet to your dreams - it is a plan to your purpose. To nail this down is highly freeing. It makes decision-making so much easier too.

#### Application

• Don't get sloppy or lazy.
So think about it, if you are fast, smart, creative, confident, a good communicator and in general - ahead of the pack, your temptation to get lazy or sloppy can be off the chart. Discipline is essential. I've been blown away at the amount of talent that amounted to nothing because discipline was not exercised. Dig in and stay tough. Know your disciplines and stick with them. I highly recommend a book by John Maxwell titled Today Matters. It will help you with 12 daily practices (disciplines) that will help you strengthen your leadership.

• Understand and appreciate others ideas and input.
Be careful of impatience, and be intentional about seeking the contribution of others. This can feel like it slows you down, but if you will give them a chance, your top leaders have more to offer than you might realize. Mining their potential requires you to invest in them, but its worth it. This is especially true for your staff. (If your staff are not sharp, why did you hire them and why do you keep them?!)

• Include implementers on the team.
I've listened to some of the best natural leaders in very large churches give this advice. We all need people on our teams who are happy to be top notch sharpies that get the job done. You give them the ball and they gain yardage - every time. They don't need or desire to be the top dog. But they can keep up with the top dog on their assignments. And if you give them some leeway, they just might run past you! How cool is that!!! Point out the right direction and let them run!! They aren't wired to dream dreams and have visions. They aspire to purpose and meaningful ministry. Give them a shot at it.

• Stay focused.
I've given more than a hint to this under the topic of distractions. It's strange how difficult this is for driven and passionate leaders, but its true. Find your focus and stick with it. I know its tough, but you don't have a choice if you really want to achieve all God has in mind for you and your church. Listening for God to speak and seeking wise counsel from a small trusted group will help you land your guiding principles and overall direction. Get that clear and never deviate. You have more room to play on the strategic pathways to get there, but even those should not be changing every few months. Again, what may feel containing is actually freeing. Focus allows you to get where you really want to go.

So, what do you think? Are you a learned leader or a natural leader? What makes you think so? You may feel you are a sort of "blend and blur" of both. That is likely true, but you are undoubtedly more one that the other. Knowing which one you are most like is vital. This is a huge gateway to strengthening your leadership.
