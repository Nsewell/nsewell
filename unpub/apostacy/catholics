In Hell I shall enjoy the company of popes, kings and princes, but in Heaven are only beggars, monks, hermits and apostles
-Not Machiavelli

"Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful." Seneca

Alexander Hamilton wrote in 1794:  Opinions, for a long time, have been gradually gaining ground, which threatens the foundations of religion, morality and society.  An attack was first made upon the Christian revelation; for which natural religion was offered as the substitute.  The Gospel was to be discarded as a gross imposture; but the being and attributes of a GOD, the obligations of piety, even the doctrine of a future state of rewards and punishments were to be retained and cherished.



Catholic propaganda on sex

Augustinian view on original sin is completely against the reality of free will, and naimal behaviour
Animals are not held to be morally responsible for their actions, yet why do bonobos masturbate?

Pretend claims
"The average teenage relationship lasts twenty-one days ater sex is brought into the picture"
"Sex outside of marriage hurts both people. Besides the obvious risks of disease and unwanted pregnancy, it scars you emotionally"
"If you follow others into premarital sex, you may follow them into divorce court as well. In fact, couples who sleep together before they're married have a divorce rate three times higher than couples who waited until their wedding night"
How could such a statistic even be obtained - other than by self reporting
In fact, it goes against the widely discussed studies that found higher divorce rates amongst religious couples
NO TRUE SCOTSMAN - if this is because they are unfaithful, then WHAT BENEFIT IN GETTING MARRIED OR EVEN BELIEVING

"Most students who have had sex with they had waited"
Most Catholics who have been guilt tripped with an abstinance only tract?

"What if I'm not a virgin? You are still worth waiting for. Maybe you lost your virginity, or maybe it was taken from you"
You still have yourself to give"

"Ever since I was a little girl, I wanted the perfect love, but after all I had done I thought I was the last person on Earth to deserve it"
Because of the "empty relationships" or Catholic indoctrination, that someone is sinful, that nothing they can do can save themselves, that if they don't goto Mass or if they aren't a "good" Catholic then they are sinful, wicked, evil people. You can't just blame secularism and the sexual revolution for people having mental health problems.
Later a quote from mother Teresa "The devil may try to use the hurts of life and sometimes our own mistakes to make you feel it is impossible that Jesus really loves you"

Memories
"Offer God your body and your memories, allowing him to heal you"
This is plainly ridiculous, as memories cannot be erased, as the tract confirms "The pictures of the other women from my past go through my head, and it's killing any intimacy". Is this married man not faithful enough to God to have the memories of his past wrongdoings removed from him? Does God just not want to act in this instance? Or is the reality that even those who cry out have no salvation, and indeed God is powerless to remove the memories of past wrongdoings. Shouldn't it then be the duty of the wife and husband, perhaps in the company of a professional councillor, to remove the hurt and improve the relationship, with honest talk about the genuine issues facing them? Not moralising and empty promises?

Shouldn't we just drop the ridiculous notion of original sin, drop the peacock feathers and the ivory towet that suggests that the religious are perfect, and have the one true and richeous way. Shouldn't they admit their problems and their faults, and admit that they aren't perfect? Shouldn't they be ready to face their own problems, with honesty and forgiveness, rather than moralising to others, blaming of scapegoats, and presuming their own richeousness?

The reality of human sexual desire is it is just that: desire. Bonobos, a higher primate with a similar brain structure to us, and over 98% of the same DNA, have been observed to masturbate and frequently have oral intercourse, including male-male and female-female. Is masturbation "original sin"
And who do you want to pray to to be kept sexually pure? Mary, Jesus's mother? The Catholics encourage their indoctrinated masess to pray "Mary, loving spouse of the Holy Spirit, I give my body to your care... Let me never sin... by any impure actions alone or with others // Hail Mary"
