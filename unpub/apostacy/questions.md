10 Questions every Christian should answer
Nick Sewell
Draft: Friday the 14th September 2012

Why is it hard to admit our mistakes?
The Ivory tower
Identifying people by their team, their group over their individual beliefs, attitudes and opinions
Tolerance & liberalism
Dog eating chicken fucking
Social rules made to moral commands - Manichean dualism
Light dark night day spirit flesh
Not throwing baby out with bathwater
-> we can do better

1. Is it OK to ask questions
Enns 

## Does my church have all the answers

Enns - club baby seals
We have the one true and final revelation on all issues, including non-salvation issues.
My opinion on scripture is the one true and only way blessed by God and all other Christians who disagree on these issues must be wrong. Please pray for them, to make them see our side of the argument, since it must be God's side.

Pray that God will give me the truth
Pray that other people will see things my way

## Is there room in my church for people who respectfully disagree?

People are increasingly afraid to voice alternative views; to argue a different case than the dominant line, for fear of being verbally abused and/or socially isolated. People are afraid to go public through fear of being crushed. This is appalling, more characteristic of a cult than of a church. I understand the desire to safeguard the truth. I too am passionate about truth, but the irony is that truth is the first casualty of efforts to stifle healthy and robust debate.
It is a sign of lack of confidence in the truth that we attempt to shut down efforts to understand it better, and if the only people we listen to are those who agree with us.

### Song of Songs
#### Is a lover to be intoxicated by love, or sex?
Your navel is a round mixing bowl / may it never lack mixed wine! 
Does the word 'navel' refer to the navel or the vulva?

NET translation note:
The noun שֹׁרֶר (shorer) is a hapax legomenon, appearing in the OT only here. There is debate whether it means "navel" or "vulva": 
(1) Lys and Pope suggest that שֹׁרֶר is related to Arabic srr ("secret place, pudenda, coition, fornication"). They suggest that this is contextually supported by three factors: 
  (a) His descriptive praise of her is in ascending order, beginning with her feet and concluding with her hair. The movement from her thighs (7:1b), to her vulva (7:2a), and then to her waist (7:2b) would fit this. 
  (b) The descriptive comparison to a glass of wine would be grotesque if her navel were in view - her navel was moist or filled with liquid? - but appropriate if her vulva were in view. 
  (c) The navel would be a somewhat synonymous reference to the belly which is already denoted by בִּטְנֵךְ (bitnekh, "belly") in the following line. Because 7:1-7 does not use synonymous parallelism, the term שֹׁרֶר would have to refer to something other than the belly. 

(2) The term שֹׁרֶר denotes "navel": 
 (a) It may be related to the bi-consonantal noun שֹׁר (shor, "navel, umbilical cord") (Prov 3:8; Ezek 16:4). 
 (b) Mishnaic Hebrew שָׁרָר (sharar) denotes "navel, umbilical cord" (Jastrow 1634 s.v. שָׁרָר). For example, in a midrash on the Book of Numbers, the noun שֹׁרֶר appears in an allusion to Song 7:3 to justify the seating of the Sanhedrin in the middle of the synagogue: "As the navel (שֹׁרֶר) is placed in the centre of the body, so are the Sanhedrin..." (Num. Rab. 1:4). On the other hand, the meaning "vulva" never appears in Mishnaic Hebrew. Therefore, apart from this disputed usage there is no evidence that this term was ever used in this manner in Hebrew. 
 (c) Rather than שֹׁרֶר being related to Arabic sirr ("pudenda"), it could just as easily be related to the Arabic noun surr "navel." It is methodologically more sound to define שֹׁרֶר as "navel" than as "vulva." 
 (d) The nuance "navel" is not as out of line contextually as Lys and Pope suggest. The navel would not be out of place in the ascending order of praise because the בִּטְנֵךְ ("abdomen") which follows may be viewed as both above and below the navel. The figurative association of the שֹׁרֶר as a mixing bowl filled with wine does not imply that this bodily part must actually be moist or filled with liquid as Pope suggests. The point of comparison is not physical or visual but one of function, i.e., it is intoxicating. The comparison of the navel to a mixing bowl of wine is no more out of line than the comparison of the belly to a heap of wheat in the next line. In fact, the two go together - she is both the "drink" and "food" for Solomon. The shape of the navel is as congruent with the metaphor of the "round bowl" as the vulva; both are round and receding. 

(3) Since both terms are derived from the same geminate root - Hebrew שֹׁרֶר and Arabic srr - it is more prudent to take the term as a synecdoche of whole (lower region) for the parts (including navel and vulva). The attempt to decide between these two options may be illegitimately splitting hairs. See K&D 18:123; J. S. Deere, "Song of Solomon," BKCOT, 199-200; D. Lys, "Notes sur de Cantique," VTSup 17 (1969): 171-78; M. H. Pope, Song of Songs (AB), 617; G. L. Carr, Song of Solomon (TOTC), 157.

#### Can parallels between Song of Songs and other poetry add to the richness of the metaphors?
![Gazelle](../Gazelle_by_BajiStock-deviantart.jpg "Gazelle by BajiStock on deviantart")

In the poem in the third papyrus of Chester Beatty the image of a Gazelle is used:
http://jewishchristianlit.com/Texts/ANEmrg/pBeatty.html
  I wish you would come quickly to your sister
  like a swiftly running gazelle on the plain,
  with stumbling feet, and weary to the bone, 
  because it is gripped with fear.
  Hunter and hounds are in hot pursuit,
  but they can’t even see it for the dust.
  It regards a place of rest as a trap 
  and takes the river as a road
  Then you will reach my cave
  even before getting your hand kissed four times
  You are in pursuit of your sister’s love
  since, my friend, the Golden One has chosen her for you.

### Context

1. Why do Adam and Eve have belly buttons?

2. How could a 600 year old man have built a floating zoo?
Noah's flood
Is it a metaphor? Not really; it's a misappropriated narrative of a Sumerian king, Ziusudra. Could a 600 year old man have single handedly built a boat the size of a destroyer out of wood? Of course not. 
Firstly, was Noah really 595? Probably not; 

How could someone in that era possibly live beyond 500?
It's possible that a scribe reading the pre-cuineform tablet mistook the base-10 numeric writing system for a base-60 one.
Firstly, Noah was 83, the ages of many in the old testament were accidentally multiplied by over 60 by the error of scribes.
Matthew Henry provides this insightful explanation
That which is especially observable is that they all lived very long; not one of them died till he had seen the revolution of almost eight hundred years, and some of them lived much longer, a great while for an immortal soul to be imprisoned in a house of clay. The present life surely was not to them such a burden as commonly it is now, else they would have been weary of it; nor was the future life so clearly revealed then as it is now under the gospel, else they would have been impatient to remove to it: long life to the pious patriarchs was a blessing and made them blessings. 1. Some natural causes may be assigned for their long life in those first ages of the world. It is very probable that the earth was more fruitful, that the productions of it were more strengthening, that the air was more healthful, and that the influences of the heavenly bodies were more benign, before the flood, than afterwards. Though man was driven out of paradise, yet the earth itself was then paradisiacal--a garden in comparison with its present wilderness-state: and some think that their great knowledge of the creatures, and of their usefulness both for food and medicine, together with their sobriety and temperance, contributed much to it; yet we do not find that those who were intemperate, as many were (Luke xvii. 27), were as short-lived as intemperate men generally are now. 2. It must chiefly be resolved into the power and providence of God. He prolonged their lives, both for the more speedy replenishing of the earth and for the more effectual preservation of the knowledge of God and religion, then, when there was no written word, but tradition was the channel of its conveyance. All the patriarchs here, except Noah, were born before Adam died; so that from him they might receive a full and satisfactory account of the creation, paradise, the fall, the promise, and those divine precepts which concerned religious worship and a religious life: and, if any mistake arose, they might have recourse to him while he lived, as to an oracle, for the rectifying of it, and after his death to Methuselah, and others, that had conversed with him: so great was the care of Almighty God to preserve in his church the knowledge of his will and the purity of his worship.

Could Noah have built a destroyer from wood? No, but he could have built a 60 metre barge.

Would a 7 metre flood destroy the world?  No, but it would flood the Euphrates river valley.

Euphrates River flood of 2900 BC
The Ark's size is an impossibility
But a barge of around 60 metres long, carrying not 'every living creature' but all of Noah's gold, silver and about 200 of his livestock is entirely believable.
Thus, the ark should not be seen as a literal account o fthe entire world flooding.
Neither is it purely a metaphor: there was likely a real flood of the Euphrates River in 2900 BC. 
Epic of Gilgamesh

Adam and Eve
No literal Adam
Francis Collins admits that there would have been 10,000 humans 100,000 years ago
John Stott - Cain would line up with human culture 40,000 years ago
Why does God do nothing for 40+ thousand years
- If there is no literal Adam and Eve, how can there be original sin
If we aren't sure about adam and eve, how can we be sure that Jesus is the salvation for all sins

Original sin?
Humans have had language for over 100k, and art and culture for at least 40k. Clearly, they have all the precursors to modern life.
At what point does man become morally responsible for his actions?
Ecclesiasties - Eccl3.11
Isn't it fundamentally immoral for God to impose free will? To "set eternity in the hearts of men" as some Bibles translate?
Didn't humans have near to our level of rational understanding and inquisition?


Doesn't this mean that original sin condemns humans after Adam, and before Jesus?
If God is a part of acting to modify humans, to change the minds of humans, or at some point starts judging them when they reach the arbitrary point of rationality.
Does God judge a stupid or mentally handicapped person today? If so, how did He not judge a species that had less mental ability 100,000 years ago.

Do we have free will? If so, what is original sin?
The Augustinian notion of free will is fucked

Why are Christians so down on women?
Eve and Lilith
wiki:lilith
Woman is a temple built on a sewer --Tertulian
Madonna/Whore complex
Virgin Mary idolized in Catholic tradition, the perfect mother who is also chaste.
To some degree, protestant women try to copy this impossibility also, internalising the damaging stereotypes that sexually empowered women are wrong, filthy and dangerous.

Augustine penis - the idea of original sin being transmitted by semen is part of the condemnation of masturbation.
The view that erections are sinful leads to the view that women, not men need to regulate expression of their sexuality. That they must be meek to avoid leading the men into sin.

### Why is the church so down on sex?
Having seen the beauty of love in Song of Songs, why does the church so frequently give people the impression that sex and sexuality are in and of themselves disgusting and shameful? Unfortunately many couples are told that sex before marriage is sinful, bu tare then expected to find out on their own how their sexuality can be used in a way that honours God.
Sex inside marriage, according to "God's design" is seen as beautiful, but anything outside is disgusting and must be stopped. Should a couple that are engaged be condemned for having sex a week before their wedding? A month? Should they cohabit to try out living together?
Answers are harder than the simplistic black and white.
Either partner could be gay if they've never had sex.
Christians starting to warm up to plain talk about sexual issues for married couples.
But pastors aren't sex therapists - and you can't always get simplistic answers to every question. The desire to have a minister explain 'this is ok, this is not ok' is rooted in not wanting to understand the hermeneutic view of scripture

Extramarital sex
Darryl Ray: God & sex, 95% premarital

Gotandem - MTD and childish believers who don't independantly read their bibles and pray 4 times a week are generally worse off than atheists. Higher rates of divorce, higher rates of child abuse, higher rates of teenage pregnancy. 
In a 2009 talk at the Resurgence church, Matt Chandler recounted his story of bringing a non-Christian woman with past relationship breakdown to a moralising church, and hearing one of the worst sermons in his life. The sermon was run of the mill moralising by an excessively conservative preacher, talking about how if someone lacks sexual purity, then they will be physically broken and drained.
Rather than preaching grace and forgiveness to the broken in love and gentleness, many preachers seek instead to instill fear and shame in the hearts of emotionally vulnerable audience concerned with their own self worth, as many young adults are. 

* You can preach love and forgiveness
* You can preach with humility and gentleness
* You can welcome the outsiders into the church, preaching that we have all sinned and come from broken homes
* Or you can preach a message of shame and guilt, because **that's all you know**.

preached that "Jesus wants the rose" - that teaching a moralising 


Moralising doesn't prevent wrongdoing, but can make people who are guilty and ashamed about their sexuality feel the need to go back to the same church to feel relieved from the guilt and shame.

Head knowledge but need to fuck. Not just have respect for being smarter.

Augustine
Semen - transfer of soul, original sin

### Why do Christians take all of the bible literally?
"The secret to survivin' is knowin' what to throw away and knowing what to keep" -- Kenny Rogers, the gambler

### Why do Christians do many of the things the Church teaches against
Peacock feathers - assumption that we are never wrong
Cheating - never take pragmatic, problem solving approach.
Materialism - commonly the church preaches against people buying the latest phone, the lastest laptop and the latest tablet. But that doesn't stop people who just bought the latest products from turning up to church to parade them around.

Christians lie all the time

Dawkins creationist video

Lack of moral cognition & opposition to relativism and debate.

### Is there such a thing as objective morality?
If there is, then why do democratic countries have legislative assemblies that can change laws and introduce new ones?
Secular laws better
Many Christians argue that atheists should read the bible because Australia's system of laws was originally based on Judeo-Chrisian values. 
If this is the case, the removal of homosexuality as a civil offence in the 60's and 70's shows the superiority of secular morality and its propensity to change with the times.

Marriage equality - needs to be understood in light of the secular world and the view of how scripture is to be read as morality for society today.
Henry the 8th

10 Commandments "do not kill" changed to "do not murder" - Draco the lawgiver? Does the bible have manslaughter?
Divorce
Usury

Collins -
10,000 humans 100,000 years
What does god do for 30k?
When is Adam?
Cain 30-49k. Sin with no salvation

http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/2011/02/21/adam-and-orthodoxy
To reject the historicity or special creation of Adam and Eve calls into question the ability of God to clearly communicate with man and undermines the authority of Scripture... If Genesis 1–3 is not literal history, then Jesus died for a mythological problem and is therefore a mythological Savior offering us a mythological hope. The glorious gospel of Christ is at stake in this battle.

Enns
Adam as Israel
http://biologos.org/blog/adam-is-israel

Israel’s history as a nation can be broken down as follows:
Israel is “created” by God at the exodus through a cosmic battle (gods are defeated and the Red Sea is “divided”);
The Israelites are given Canaan to inhabit, a lush land flowing with milk and honey;
They remain in the land as long as they obey the Mosaic law;
They persist in a pattern of disobedience and are exiled to Babylon.

Israel’s history parallels Adam’s drama in Genesis:
Adam is created in Genesis 2 after the taming of chaos in Genesis 1;
Adam is placed in a lush garden;
Law (not to eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil) is given as a stipulation for remaining in the garden;
Adam and Eve disobey and are exiled.

### Why can church feel lonely for some people?
Women in the anglican church can be isolated and ignored for their singleness
http://sydneyanglicans.net/life/daytoday/single_christian_female_30
    “It is so painfully lonely not fitting in and feeling socially worthless, particularly when you hear about all the social gatherings that go on, none of which you ever receive an invitation to. It is awful.”

    “It is really hard to continue going to church when every week you know you will be left out after the meeting. It is painful watching friends greet each other and give out invites and be all happy and together.”

    “I am looking for a little bit of love from my Christian community, but instead I feel like a leper… I never get invited anywhere.”

    “People think that you must be busy Friday and Saturday nights, and the reality is, that you’re sitting at home in front of the TV…”

    “I have not met any single person in their 30s who is not really hurting… Get to your mid 30s, when all your friends are married, the reality is that while your married friends' social network is rapidly expanding, the single persons' network is rapidly diminishing.”


### Does leaving the church mean that someone has failed?

Church tribalism
"the more exclusive the group, the more pretense is needed to establish and maintain the group, and thus the more self-righteous and immoral it becomes."
