“I’m here to undo abstinence education in two hours — that’s my superpower,” he said. “We live in a sex-phobic culture.”

>Another close friend once in a moment of purging his guilt before leaving on his mission confided to me his own unique strategy. We lived in a farm community and he decided that since he had never heard that sex with animals was sinful he was safer to place a stool behind a cow to stand on and have sex with it than he was to masturbate. His dad, by the way, was our stake president and his uncle was a notable apostle. We had never heard of bestiality. He too was trying to cope. Today he is a respectable judge, family man and priesthood leader in his community.

 "Does Early Adolescent Sex Cause Depressive Symptoms?"

17.9% of College students report occasionally feeling guilty about engaging in sexual intercourse

>In keeping with the gendered, socially encouraged sexual expressions of women and men, women also tended to report more conservative sexual attitudes and less sexual comfort than did men. For example, women were significantly less likely than were men to agree that premarital sex is acceptable with a casual acquaintance.

>Women with slight or no guilt were 2.8 times as likely as women with extreme or considerable guilt to be extremely psychologically satisfied
>Men with slight or no sexual guilt were 3.8 times more likely than were men with extreme or considerable sexual guilt to be psychologically satisfied

>More emotional issues such as sexual guilt were also strongly associated with both types of sexual satisfaction for men (sexual guilt was associated with psychological satisfaction for women as well). Feminist scholarship has skillfully documented the ways in which girls are socialized to feel ashamed or suspect about their own sexual desires,6,49 and research indicates that young women with high levels of sexual guilt tend to experience less sexual arousal and less enjoyment in their early sexual encounters.23 However, few studies have shown a similar effect among young men or have explored the effects of guilt on young men's sexual self-concept and enjoyment. As expected, young men in our sample had significantly lower levels of sexual guilt than did young women

> Masturbation. The habit of masturbation is degrading 
and is likely to interfere with the normal development of 
the sexual organs. It may also be responsible for early loss 
of sexual power (impotence).
