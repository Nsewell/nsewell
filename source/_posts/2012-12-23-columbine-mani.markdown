Another idiotic message is floating around on Facebook, explaining shootings as God's will. I could point out everything wrong with it, but don't have the time or patience. Fundamentally it falls for the Manichean mistake of assuming that the world is made up of light and shadow, and that there are no morally gray areas. The simplistic and childish argument basically follows that since everyone who goes to church is a "good guy", that the government doesn't need to restrict firearms to reduce homicides and mass murders, but instead needs to "church" the "bad guys", because Christianity is a solution to everything, not [part of the problem][rlc-problem].

The Facebook message goes like this:

>Scott, the father of Rachel Scott, a victim of the Columbine High School shootings in Littleton, Colorado, was invited to address the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee. What he said to our national leaders during this special session of Congress was painfully truthful.
>They were not prepared for what he was to say, nor was it received well. It needs to be heard by every parent, every teacher, every politician, every sociologist, every psychologist, and every so-called expert! These courageous words spoken by Darrell Scott are powerful, penetrating, and deeply personal. There is no doubt that God sent this man as a voice crying in the wilderness. The following is a portion of the transcript:
>
>"Since the dawn of creation there has been both good &evil in the hearts of men and women. We all contain the seeds of kindness or the seeds of violence. The death of my wonderful daughter, Rachel Joy Scott, and the deaths of that heroic teacher, and the other eleven children who died must not be in vain. Their blood cries out for answers.
>"The first recorded act of violence was when Cain slew his brother Abel out in the field. The villain was not the club he used.. Neither was it the NCA, the National Club Association. The true killer was Cain, and the reason for the murder could only be found in Cain's heart.

It goes without saying that clubs require tedious effort to kill one person, whereas the killers in Columbine and Sandy Hook used semi automatic assault rifles with 30 round magazines and 100 round drums. It also goes without saying that Christians sin all the time, and are meant to throw off the "rags" of sin that still "cling" to them despite their religious observance. This pointless "people kill people" argument overlooks that [4 year olds can kill 2 year olds by mishandling firearms][toddler]. It overlooks that in China a crazy man stabbing 20 school children killed none of them. Eliminating violence will never be achievable, while restricting access to firearms is substantially easier than pro gun advocates will admit.

This excellent article [destroys most of the rest of this nonsense][rlc-hook]:

>To blame a lack of reliance on God for this most recent tragedy is a slap in the face of the victims and their families who attended church before or after the shooting... If Christians want to place blame, blame the culture of violence—not the Prince of Peace

>We do not need the government forcing us to say officially-sanctioned prayers in school each day.  Do we think being forced to say a prayer is any prayer at all?  Do we think that in the not-so-distant days of Christendom, when all members of society were considered “Christian” and our nations were “Christian,” that faith was genuine? We have come so far and need to respect the rights of other religious traditions.  We argue for freedom for our missionaries to evangelize in Islamic countries but then we want to remake America in their same restrictive mold.  Sure, today, our faith is sometimes looked down upon, marginalized, and spat on—but the church is in a much better place now that we have regained the pre-Constantinian role of sojourners in a sinful world rather than the inquisitors of godless governments.

The rest of the specious bullshit follows:

>"In the days that followed the Columbine tragedy, I was amazed at how quickly fingers began to be pointed at groups such as the NRA. I am not a member of the NRA. I am not a hunter. I do not even own a gun. I am not here to represent or defend the NRA - because I don't believe that they are responsible for my daughter's death. Therefore I do not believe that they need to be defended. If I believed they had anything to do with Rachel's murder I would be their strongest opponent
>I am here today to declare that Columbine was not just a tragedy -- it was a spiritual event that should be forcing us to look at where the real blame lies! Much of the blame lies here in this room. Much of the blame lies behind the pointing fingers of the accusers themselves. I wrote a poem just four nights ago that expresses my feelings best. 
>
>Your laws ignore our deepest needs,
>Your words are empty air.
>You've stripped away our heritage,
>You've outlawed simple prayer.
>Now gunshots fill our classrooms,
>And precious children die.
>You seek for answers everywhere,
>And ask the question "Why?"
>You regulate restrictive laws,
>Through legislative creed.
>And yet you fail to understand,
>That God is what we need!
>
>"Men and women are three-part beings. We all consist of body, mind, and spirit. When we refuse to acknowledge a third part of our make-up, we create a void that allows evil, prejudice, and hatred to rush in and wreak havoc. Spiritual presences were present within our educational systems for most of our nation's history. Many of our major colleges began as theological seminaries. This is a historical fact. 
>What has happened to us as a nation? We have refused to honor God, and in so doing, we open the doors to hatred and violence. And when something as terrible as Columbine's tragedy occurs -- politicians immediately look for a scapegoat such as the NRA. They immediately seek to pass more restrictive laws that contribute to erode away our personal and private liberties. We do not need more restrictive laws. 
>Eric and Dylan would not have been stopped by metal detectors. No amount of gun laws can stop someone who spends months planning this type of massacre. The real villain lies within our own hearts. 
>
>"As my son Craig lay under that table in the school library and saw his two friends murdered before his very eyes, he did not hesitate to pray in school. I defy any law or politician to deny him that right! I challenge every young person in America , and around the world, to realize that on April 20, 1999, at Columbine High School prayer was brought back to our schools. Do not let the many prayers offered by those students be in vain. Dare to move into the new millennium with a sacred disregard for legislation that violates your God-given right to communicate with Him. 
>
>To those of you who would point your finger at the NRA -- I give to you a sincere challenge.. Dare to examine your own heart before casting the first stone! 
>My daughter's death will not be in vain! The young people of this country will not allow that to happen!"
>- Darrell Scott

>Do what the media did not - - let the nation hear this man's speech. Please share this with your FB friends!
