I just came across one of the most condescending, self righteous and judgemental Christian tracts to shame young people about their lives I've ever seen.

> Within you there is an emptiness - a vacuum. You've tried to find satisfaction. Drinking, smoking, petting, indulging in shameful sex acts has not filled that void. Yet, you seek for greater thrills, you cultivate a deeper love for the pleasures of this world. You've tried to convince yourself that you are happy, but *HELL* rages within.
> 
> *SOON!* you will stand before the almighty God on the judgment day and give an account of every dirty joke, curse word, evil action and neglected opportunity of being saved from all sin.
> 
> *REPENTANCE* means confessing all our sins... *REPENTANCE* means forsaking all sin, a complete turning away from being a rebel, from ungodly friends, form conformity with the world, from secret sins and habits of the flesh, from filthy books and naked photographs, from dirty stories and unclean jokes, from everything and everybody that would hinder you from being one hundred percent for Jesus Christ...
> 
> *REPENTANCE* means making restitution. In other words, make your back paths straight; make things right with those whom you have wronged. This includes taking back stolen property or paying back stolen money. Restitution involves asking of forgiveness of parents for improper attitudes towards them, disobedience, and disrespect.

Of course most tracts aren't intended to convert people to Christianity, just to satisfy the 'evangelist' that they are doing their job by presenting the very worst of Christian judgementalism. Jack Chick's [rabid anti-Catholic sentiment makes this clear][catholic]:

Of course, people giving out these tracts don't care about how the recipients receive them, they are really only there to give out as many tracts as quickly as possible [to appease other Christians][smackdown]:
