Throughout history, the bible has been used as justification for various wars. Dr. Eric Seibert suggests that modern readers [should be mindful of the consequences of][enns1] a literal interpretation of problematic Old Testament passages:

[enns1]:http://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/2013/02/when-the-good-book-is-bad-challenging-the-bibles-violent-portrayals-of-god/
> What happens when reading the Bible pushes people away from God rather than leads them closer to God?
>
>If we feel compelled to accept what we read at face value, and are forbidden from asking honest questions about the troublesome texts we encounter, we run the risk of using the Bible in ways that may harm others

In many Old Testament passages, Seibert writes, "lethal violence is condoned and sometimes even celebrated.  Passages like these create significant problems for Christian readers." He [continues][enns2]:

[enns2]:http://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/2013/02/when-the-bible-sanctions-violence-must-we/
>It is extremely dangerous to endorse violent texts like these. Tragically, this kind of approval has often led to future acts of violence against others...
>
>As Christians, we have a moral obligation to critique the assumption that violence is somehow “virtuous,” in spite of what the Bible suggests on numerous occasions.
>
>Violence is not a virtue. It is not a fruit of the spirit or a mark of discipleship... There are no moral grounds for slaughtering babies, infants, or toddlers. Yet the Bible justifies their extermination on more than one occasion.
>
>Surely, those of us who follow the prince of Peace, the God of Life, must raise our voices in protest and object. We must say, “This is not right!” Such violence is never justifiable and should never be condoned.

Seibert [suggests that readers engage with violence by trying to empathise with the victims][enns3]. This would be in line with Jesus's teaching on the golden rule.

The question he's getting at is whether violence in the Old Testament demonstrates inspiration if it must be resolved with an apparent contradiction with the incarnation of Logos. Working though these issues and understanding the history and interpreting the OT though an NT lens, without interposing modern secular moral standards.

>Reading this way sensitizes us to the problem of violence in these texts and keeps us from simplistically classifying such moral atrocities as good.
>
>The conquest narrative in Joshua 6-11 reminds us that religious violence is extremely dangerous because it gives divine sanction to behaviors that in any other context would be deemed immoral. Moreover, if one assumes the narrative was intended to bolster the political ambitions of King Josiah, it stands as a sober reminder of the way political leaders sometimes use religion to promote their own agendas.
