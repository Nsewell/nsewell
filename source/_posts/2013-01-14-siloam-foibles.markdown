Bryan Fisher of the American Family Association says that God allows natural calamities so that God can discipline people, like a parent giving a child a spank.

I guess someone had better tell Jesus, he seems to have gotten his theology wrong in Luke 13:

>There were some present at that very time who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. *2* And he answered them, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered in this way? *3* No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. *4* Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them: do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in Jerusalem? *5* No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.”

With Cindy Jacobs getting new prophesy all the time, of course Jesus would need to update some of his more old hat ideas. And Fisher should probably tell Job who seems to make a fuss about his friends rightly criticising him for his slapping:

>  2 "I have heard many things like these before.     
>  What miserable comforters are you all!   
>  3 Will there be an end to your windy words?  
>  Or what provokes you that you answer?    
>  4 I also could speak like you,   
>  if you were in my place;   
>  I could pile up words against you   
>  and I could shake my head at you.   
>  5 But I would strengthen you with my words;   
>  comfort from my lips would bring you relief.   

What a whiny peter pan man-boy. He must not have been given enough discipline in public schools, now all he has is an entitlement culture. Guess we'll just have to write off the mind of another youth after the softness of 'developmental psychology' turned it to much. We see this with his complete disrespect for the scriptural knowledge of his betters

>  Job 15:8: Do you listen in on God's secret council? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?   
>  Job 15:9: What do you know that we don't know? What do you understand that we don't understand?   
>  Job 15:10: The gray-haired and the aged are on our side, men far older than your father.   
>  Job 15:11: Are God's consolations too trivial for you; or a word spoken in gentleness to you?   

Unfortunately "sin inspires his mouth; he chooses the language of the crafty" because he just wants to sin and do whatever he wants, just like a standard drug-addled liberal. Of course he doesn't recognise God's wisdom when we give it to him.

Now there is a liberal hoax that **claims** that this man is "blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil". But really, have you seen the *long form* of his birth certificate? I didn't think so. Stick it on the pile with climate change, heliocentrism and the germ theory of disease. Pfft, those scientists and their **theories**. You can't trust theories when it comes to life and death.

Similarly someone should tell Yahweh as well (just in case Jesus forgot to pass it on to himself) - clearly God was meant to punish Job, not the miserable comforters that rightly point out Job's sin causing all these natural disasters to be brought on himself. Their message might not be popular, but it sure is 'biblical' (in a sense), and they should be praised for preaching it boldly.

>  Job 42:7: After the LORD had spoken these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, "My anger is stirred up against you and your two friends, because you have not spoken about me what is right, as my servant Job has.  
>  Job 42:8: So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and offer a burnt offering for yourselves. And my servant Job will intercede for you, and I will respect him, so that I do not deal with you according to your folly, because you have not spoken about me what is right, as my servant Job has."   
>  Job 42:9: So they went, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and did just as the LORD had told them; and the LORD had respect for Job.   

Geez, this socialist seems to be engaging in class warfare.
