Christians in the West have a habit of making all the depictions of biblical figures white. This is painfully evident in The Bible series on the History Channel. The series starts its Eurocentric presentation of Jewish scriptures with Adam and Eve as white supermodels:

![Adam and Eve as white supermodels](/images/adam-eve.jpg)

At least they figured out that "forbidden fruit" is a fig, long believed to be an aphrodisiac in the Middle East. The producers also cast Mohamen Mehdi Ouazanni as Satan, someone [many have commented has a resemblence to Barak Obama][obama-satan]:

While Jesus is shown as distinctively Causasian, Samson was cast as a black actor leading Reverend Wil Gafney to call the series ["a continuation of slave-holding racist exegesis."][gafney] The December 2002 cover of Popular Mechanics featured a [reconstruction of the faces of males from around the time of Jesus][mechanics]. The New Testament says that Jesus disappeared into crowds, and if Jesus looked like other men of the time this is what he would have looked like:

![Black Jesus by Popular Mechanics](/images/black-jesus-face.jpg)

The Irish producer Roma Downey chose to cast herself as Mary the mother of Jesus, and chose to give the role of Jesus of Nazareth to a similarly white skinned Portugese actor Diogo Morgado:

If Jesus ever had hair this long, he'd probably get it stuck in his vice or his lathe. Europeans love to show Jesus with long hair, despite Paul's teaching in 1 Corinthians 11:14 clearly specifying "Does not nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace for him". In fact, many contemporary scholars have noted that the Corinthian church existed at a time when male prostitutes had longer hair than other men to make them stand out as homosexuals. And despite all this, ever since the [Jesus movement][jesus-movement] co-opted New Age culture of the 70's, modern renditions of Jesus show him as a long haired white hippie.

But this isn't the only way that Westerners present biblical stories specifically moulded to their target audience, against the grain of what the bible actually says. Western individualists love to read bible passages as written specifically for them, ignoring the original audience and context. For most of the history of Christianity, lay people did not read scriputre themselves, they had the bible read in a corporate context. It wasn't until 1455 that [Johannes Gutenberg mass produced 180 bibles][gutenberg-bible] and until 1561 that John Knox demanded universal education.

Now Americans complain that while most [own four to seven bibles they hardly ever get time to read them][seven-bibles]. Instead they'll be coerced to read the bible [25 words at a time][25-words]. Not only are Westerners time-poor, they all too often seek a ["reaffirmation of the individualistic, me-centered, and consumerist tendencies of American religious culture."][held-evans-ind] Many megachurches are happy to give them a "seeker friendly" doctrine written by and for modern American individualists:

>Passages that were originally written for groups of people, and intended to be read and applied in a community setting (the nation of Israel, the various early churches, the first followers of Jesus), have been manipulated to communicate a personal, individual message...
>
>We see this everywhere: in worship set lists that focus exclusively on individual worship, individual sin, and individual connection to God; in desk calendars that turn Jeremiah 29:11 (“For I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord…”)  into a personal promise; in the disproportionate emphasis in our churches on personal Bible study, personal prayer, and one’s “personal walk with God.” 

Worse, publishers responding to people who like the sound of their own names will "personalize" the bible for them, massaging scripture into an ego stoking circlejerk. Isiah 53 no longer reads "he was pierced for **our** transgressions" but can be made to say "he was pierced for **Rachel's** transgressions. He was crushed for **Rachel's** iniquities." The website lets you put in literally any name at all:

![The bible according to Jeffrey Dahmer](/images/dahmer.jpg)

### It ain't in the bible, but it outta be

This culture is happy to change the bible not only to suit the emotional desires of materialists but also to make it suit contemporary social and political needs. Often Jesus is not presented as a redeemer saving individuals into a community, but is presented as a "package deal" that will provide for individual emotional and physical wants and needs, so long as they conform to the social and political aims of the church of the day.

Making the message "culturally relevant" can lead to presenting cultural idiosyncrasies along with religious doctrines until the two become confused. Right wing Christians love to say phrases like "God helps those who help themselves". When challenged on where in the bible it actually says it, they'll usually respond "well it ain't in the bible, but it outta be". Other common platitudes like "When God closes a door he opens a window" might give comfort to those struggling with flatulence, but are similarly unscriptural.

Ultimately many Christians don't view God though the bible, they view the bible through the lens of the culture they're in, which is why their god's actions and character reflect their own personal desires and perferences. When one's understanding of the Christian God is grounded in pre-existing cultural and social assumptions, statements like this make sense:

![God as husband](/images/god-husband.jpg)

[marriage-gospel]:http://www.everystudent.com/features/wolves.html
This "deal" is not the gospel of Christianity, it's a [load of crap, and a lie, and a load of bollocks][steffy]. If they don't get these stupid ideas from the bible, where do they get them from? There is a widespread cultural assumption that "everyone knows" that god wants people to marry "the one" for them. Many Christians are happy to play into cultural anxieties about love, sex and singleness to present marriage as part of the "package deal" of Christianity. Dagmar Herzog describes the American religious right as pushing a regressive social agenda by painting a rosy picture of marriage, and building on the insecurities of sexual inexperience in youth:

The Materialistic Western culture is built on functional saviours. Shampoo is sold to people by telling them that unclean hair makes them undesirable, then promising to make them beautiful if they buy more product. Targetting this culture with "seeker friendly" material often means presenting a relationship Jesus as a functional saviour, a means to an end for the individual, rather than an end in and of itself. "The most important relationship you can have -- one that will make you a better husband and father -- is a relationship with God" reads an altar call in one [mendacious promise of long lasting and happy marriages][marriage-gospel]. Another promises "[hope for a lasting marriage][es-marriage]" if only one accepts Jesus. Others offer Jesus as a way for [men][es-male] and [women][es-female] to stop looking at porn. People accepting these altar calls and praying their sinner's prayers will never know what they've accepted unless they read the bible to understand what is actually in it, and what "outta be".

### Myths and misinformation pushing shame and intimidation

The relationships altar call comes after two and a half A4 pages of bullshit about how "Waiting to have sex with my wife will mean better sex in my marriage." It launches into all the standard canards Christians have been told to believe "the more I bond with other girls, the less I'll be able to bond with my future wife. It's like a piece of scotch tape -- the more you use it on different surfaces, the less it sticks to things." When entire mission strategies are built around ignorance on sex and relationships, Christians will do anything in their power to promote misinformation. Because they are offering Chrsitianity as a solution to problems of their own making.

Abstinance only sex education programs reinforce ignorance in 30% of United States public schools. They [teach canards like][siecus] “Condoms can never protect someone from the emotional problems that can result from multiple sexual partners and premature sexual activity.” And “AIDS can be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact.” They discourage the responsible use of barrier methods like condoms, teaching that “The only safe sex is in a marriage relationship where a man and a woman are faithful to each other for life.”         

These programs not only promote the idea that premarital sex has risks, but demonises it as permanantly scarring. “If [a girl] has been involved in sexual activity…sexually, she is no longer a virgin, she is no longer pure, unspoiled, fresh" they teach. They warn that “The consequences of pre-marital sex include “guilt, disappointment, worry, depression, sadness, loneliness, and loss of self-esteem.” They warn 6th grade children "Going on this ride could change your life forever, result in poverty, heartache, disease, and even DEATH.” It goes on to say that many “will board this ride and come out losers.” The manual goads “did you know that sexual activity outside of the commitment of marriage could put YOUR FUTURE at risk?”

If you don't believe that they teach children that they'll die, watch this:

[chic]:http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-10-27/entertainment/0510260352_1_disgusting-paul-rozin-important-part
These teachings encourage a culture of shame and permanent condemnation. In a survey, when researchers dropped a live cockroach into orange juice, then removed the cockroach and sterilised the juice, [the majority of participants wouldn't drink it][food-purity]. Paul Rozin, author of the study also found that [40% of participants would refuse to eat poo-shaped chocolate, or drink juice from a brand-new bedpan][chic]. Even when people know that disgusting looking food is safe to eat, emotionally, many refuse. While many sins that the bible speaks against are presented as mistakes, conservative evangelicals always talk about sexual integrity in terms of purity. They encourage the view that anyone who isn't a virgin is permanantly broken, corrupted, contaminated and that they cannot make themselves clean again.

### The overreach and failure of the purity doctrine

[syd-single]:http://sydneyanglicans.net/life/daytoday/single_christian_female_30
Demonising pre-marital sex as permanantly scarring and unforgivable has created a culture in which people are afraid even to date. "There is no condom for the human heart" teach the fear mongers. They preach not only that virginity is the most important gift a girl can give her husband, but that they should be "emotional virgins" and not ["give away pieces of their heart."](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2011/09/love-virginity.html) This is bullshit. And yet, it has almost lured a [whole generation out of dating until they are sure they can marry](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2012/10/what-i-learned-from-joshua-harris.html). This hooks into the intuition that "everyone knows" that God will provide them with "the one", which "outta be" in the bible there somewhere. Single Christian women who spend the last decade in the purity culture suddenly find themselves [ostracised and isolated as church ministries direct all their 30+ ministries to families][syd-single].

Many women have given up on wearing purity rings. For some, it's because they [feel complete in their relationship with Jesus, and aren't "waiting" anymore][dontwait]

>There are a lot of girls out there who don’t know who God is anymore – the God of their youth group years just isn’t working out. Back then, that God said to wait for sex until they are married, until He brings the right man along for a husband. They signed a card and put it on the altar and pledged to wait...
>
>Some of them have prayed their whole lives for a husband, and he hasn’t shown up. They’ve heard the advice to “be the woman God made you to be, focus on that, and then the husband will come.” They’ve read “Lady in Waiting,” gotten super involved in church and honed their domestic skills.
>
>More than a decade ago, a youth leader handed them a photocopied poem in Sunday School written to them from “God” that said, “The reason you don’t have anyone yet is because you’re not fully satisfied in Me. You have to be satisfied with Me and then when you least expect it, I’ll bring you the person I meant for you.”
>
>...Many of them – if they’re honest – will tell you that time has passed, and it’s wrecking their view of God.

Others have given up on the culture of bullying and intimidation that [accompanies the purity culture](http://sexetc.org/info-center/post/why-i-stopped-wearing-a-purity-ring/)

>Originally, when I made the commitment to wait until marriage, I really only saw my ring as a symbol of how personally valuable my virginity was to me. However, after I saw how readily my peers bullied and mocked girls who they thought were sexually active, my ring seemed like more of a constant reminder of how dirty and useless people might think I was if I wasn’t a virgin anymore.

[pmc-baptists]:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3156853/
For some, it's the knowledge that [95% of Americans have sex before marriage][pmc-premarital], or that [Five years after taking a virginity pledge, 82% of pledgers denied having ever pledged][pmc-pledge]. Others note that even in Southern Baptist churches [70% of engaged Christians quietly have sex before marrying][pmc-baptists]. Many women who hit this inevitable conclusion are finding the courage to speak out about the [deep and long lasting damage of the purity culture][emily-maynard]:

[emily-maynard]:http://www.prodigalmagazine.com/the-day-i-turned-in-my-v-card/
>  I broke a barrier and gave up an idea I’d held onto as a “Good Christian Girl” for a long, long time. If you grew up in American Christian culture, you know that a statement like mine is one of the most life changing, socially desolating, parentally disappointing pronouncements you can make. Especially if you’re a girl.  
>
>  But I don’t care anymore; I’m done with virginity.  
>
>  I’m done with that word and that idea. I’m done defining myself, my past and my future, in terms of who’s what has been where, or hasn’t. I’m done with stories for virgins and non-virgins, promises and praises, and sentiments of “restoration” that just push forward bulldozer loads of this horrible twisted shame.  

[sarah-bessy]:http://deeperstory.com/i-am-damaged-goods/
Others are speaking out for those who have [been damaged by the notion that their sexual past is keeping them back from being a Christian][sarah-bessy]

>  I was nineteen years old and crazy in love with Jesus when that preacher told an auditorium I was “damaged goods” because of my sexual past. He was making every effort to encourage this crowd of young adults to “stay pure for marriage.” He was passionate, yes, well-intentioned, and he was a good speaker, very convincing indeed.  
>
>  And he stood up there and shamed me, over and over and over again.  
>
>  Oh, he didn’t call me up to the front and name me. But he stood up there and talked about me with such disgust, like I couldn’t be in that real-life crowd of young people worshipping in that church. I felt spotlighted and singled out amongst the holy, surely my red face announced my guilt to every one...  
>
>  And so here, now, I’ll stand up and say it, the way I wish someone had said it to me fifteen years ago when I was sitting in that packed auditorium with my heart racing, wrists aching, eyes stinging, drowning and silenced by the imposition of shame masquerading as ashes of repentance:  
>
>  “So, you had sex before you were married.  
>
>  It’s okay.  
>
>  Really. It’s okay.  
>
>  There is no shame in Christ’s love. Let him without sin cast the first stone. You are more than your virginity – or lack thereof – and more than your sexual past.  

[elizabeth-esther]:http://www.elizabethesther.com/2013/01/virginity-new-improved.html
Others who kept their virginity are also [pushing back on the purity culture that teaches that non-sexual relationships are as dangerous as sexual ones][elizabeth-esther]:

>  Yes, I was a virgin on my wedding day. Then again, I was only 20. Yes, remaining a virgin until my wedding day saved me from some romantic heartbreak. Then again, I’ve had other heartbreaks. Yes, chastity is special. Then again, so are lots of virtues. Except, as a 20 year old bride, I thought virginity was extra-extra special and would win me lots of special prizes like: a happily ever after marriage.
>  
>  It took me a long time to realize I idolized virginity. I kept saying I was just promoting virtue and chastity and purity! Nothing wrong with pushing purity, right? Nothing wrong with Being Good!
>  
>  Like other Christians, I talked about the “sacrifice” of abstinence. There were princess-themed books about saving our first kiss. Some of us wore purity rings and made pledges to our Daddies not to have sex until we’re married.
>
>  Ultimately, we implied that **a woman’s inherent worth and dignity could be measured by whether or not a man has touched her**.

As women who spend their young adult years believing that pre-marital sex is "not all it's cracked up to be" start hitting struggles in their own "perfect" marriages, the church is happy to offer a whole industry of Christian sex advice.

### Race to the bottom

This gospel offers "perfect" sex in a "perfect" marriage so long as one accepts the "package deal" of White Jesus with the cultural vestments of looking, sounding and voting Christian.
