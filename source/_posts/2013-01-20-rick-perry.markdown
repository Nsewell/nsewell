Rick Perry, governer of Texas has come out against gun control, suggesting to Christians that [prayer works better than gun control][perry]:
>  Guns require a finger to pull the trigger. The sad young man who did that in Newtown was clearly haunted by demons and no gun law could have saved the children in Sandy Hook Elementary from his terror.  
>
>  There is evil prowling in the world – it shows up in our movies, video games and online fascinations, and finds its way into vulnerable hearts and minds. As a free people, let us choose what kind of people we will be.  Laws, the only redoubt of secularism, will not suffice.  Let us all return to our places of worship and pray for help. Above all, let us pray for our children.  
>
>  In fact, the piling on by the political left, and their cohorts in the media, to use the massacre of little children to advance a pre-existing political agenda that would not have saved those children, disgusts me, personally.  The second amendment to the Constitution is a basic right of free people and cannot be nor will it be abridged by the executive power of this or any other president.

Perry claims that "no gun law could have saved the children in Sandy Hook Elementary from his terror". Even if the killer Lanza was possessed by a demon, gun laws do indeed save lives. On the same day as the Sandy Hook killings, a mentally ill man in the Chinese provence of Guanxi [wounded 22 children in a school stabbing rampage][china-knife]. All of the children survived. To say that gun laws have no effect is nonsense, and the Chinese example proves that it is easier to eliminate firearms in a society than mental health issues.

If Rick Perry believes that laws are a "redoubt of secularism" then we must ask, what is the function of the governor of a state other than to create laws to make her citizens safe and prosperous? If it is to call citizens to "pray for help", I think he's confused the state for the church. A common mistake among born-again Christians these days.

To blame a lack of prayer reliance on God for these tragedies is a slap in the face of the victims and their families who attended church before or after the shooting. In fact, religion may be more a part of the [problem of violence than the solution][religion-problem]:

>When American Christians are more supportive of weapons, war and torture than their unbelieving neighbors, something has gone terribly wrong. When the greatest amount of violence is found precisely in the region of the country where church membership and attendance is the highest we might ask what kind of influence Christians are exerting. Complaints about a lack of official prayer in schools or an absence of religious symbols in the public square don’t get even close to identifying the source of the violence problem.

Rather than discussing real solutions to mental health issues, Perry goes on to blame the entertainment industry and "evil prowling in the world". Violent video games and movies have long been criticized for inspiring murders. After the 1999 mass murder in Columbine, Franklin Graham commented that the [tragedy has strengthened his belief that guns aren't to blame for gun violence][graham]. Rather, Graham said that the entertainment industry is "awash in killings, shootings and rapes. We are complete fools if we don't think that today's entertainment has poisoned a generation. I've always believed this but I believe it more now."

There is a smattering of research showing a tenuous correlation between violent media and anti-social behaviour, but there is no proof of causation. Given that the entertainment industry has most of their products protected under free speech rights in the First Amendment to the US Constitution, it's dissapointing that the governor has not sought genuine solutions 13 years on.

The abuse of religion by the far right in America is a phenomenon that is drawing more and more negative attention. When evangelical leaders called school shootings [god's will][rentier] many Christians cautiously distance themselves. Unfortunately while some have downplayed the significance of [a few "crazy uncles" and insist that mainstream Christianity is not a hate group][uncles], Perry joining the chorus is not going to help.

Albert Mohler described the Republican loss of the 2012 presidential race as an "[evangelical disaster][evangelical-disaster]". Rachel Held Evans responded that "the great evangelical disaster is that evangelicalism has become synonymous with Republicanism rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ." Gun control measures like [universal background checks supported by 85% of Republicans][pew-guns]. I'd say that the real disaster is that evangelicalism is being used as an excuse, or worse, as a justification to push political inaction on something the majority of the country wants because the NRA is lining their pockets. If Christians don't change their trajectory, I don't think there will be much of a church left in another 13 years. And the only explanation they'll have for it is to blame violent video games for "corrupting the youth".
