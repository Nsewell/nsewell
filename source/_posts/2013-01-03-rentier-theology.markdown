It's common to hear right wing editorials and chain letters advancing arguments to the effect that if society only did X (like they did in the "good old days") then every social ill would be cured. This commonly plays on misconceptions based on alarmist media reports that [violence in Western societies is getting worse][gallup] while in reality violent crime [is at the lowest levels ever thoughout the West][pinker].

Many people think that [crime in the Australia is worsening][worldtoday], and that the majority of crime involves violence. Unfortunately, the media frequently presents [misleading commentary on crime figures][bocsar], suggesting that small localised variations in crime rates are indicitive of a trend towards mayhem and chaos. This has lead to an evaporation of public confidence in the [ability for the criminal justice system to deal with crime fairly and adequately][aic-2009]. A study of Tasmanian jurors found that while 80% of the public believe that courts are too lenient in sentencing, [90% of of jurors informed on information about crime cases thought that the judge in the case gave an adequate sentence][aic-juror].

Despite the reality that courts are generally in line with Australian expectations on crime sentencing, misinformed conservatives are pushing in various states for mandatory minimum sentences, based on the idea that politicians, pundits and focus groups know more about how to deal with crime than lawyers, academics and judges. These policies would [dramatically increase the prison population][newman], putting pressure on the public corrections system to build more prisons. Private prison companies would likely be commissioned to increase prisons capacity at lower cost. But as [The Economist warns][economist], "The great hazard of contracting out incarceration "services" is that private firms may well turn out to be even more efficient and effective than unions in lobbying for policies that would increase prison populations."


This has indeed happend in America, not just with prisons lobbying government to maintain "demand" for their services, but directly [bribing judges to increase the sentences for offenders][naked-prison]. The for profit prisons industry is concerned that "any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them." They also list good policing as a risk to their business: "reductions in crime rates or resources dedicated to prevent and enforce crime could lead to reductions in arrests, convictions and sentences requiring incarceration at correctional facilities." As the saying goes, if you're not part of the solution, prolong the problem for as long as possible.

The next time you hear a conservative pundit decrying the "softness" of judges and insisting on "tough on crime" policies you should ask yourself: "is this supported by the evidence?" And if not, what's behind this? Who benefits? Is it simply incompetence or is it malice? Is it just yellow journalism to sell tabloids or is there an economic incentive in perpetuating the misinformation that violent crime is on the rise, or that current drug policy is working? 

Often those pushing a conservative moral argument [have no idea where their financial backing comes from][baptists-bootleggers]. Politics makes for strange bedfellows, with polticians often acting as a go-between with conservative moralisers and those with a financial agenda. During the prohibition era, Baptists were known to ally in their support of alcohol bans with bootleggers that profited from them. The preachers wanted to ban alcohol so that church wouldn't compete with pubs on the "Lord's day". The bootleggers wanted their monopoly on the sale of alcohol. It leads to faulty theology like this, a billboard encouraging voters in a dry town not to legalise the sale of alcohol, saying that a vote for legal alcohol is a re-crucifixion of Jesus.
[baptists-bootleggers]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootleggers_and_Baptists

![Baptists and Bootleggers](/images/BaptistsAndBootleggers.jpg "Baptists and Bootleggers")

A minor problem with this sign is that it's not only hysterical, it's completely unbiblical. The sign references Hebrews 10:29, which warns that church-goers who "deliberately keep on sinning" can be guilty of re-crucifying Jesus drink communion wine in an unworthy manner ("profaning the blood of the covenant"). To say that this prohibits the sale of alcohol for non-religious consumption is a misapplication of scripture. Most Christian denominations support the moderate consumption of alcohol (but condemn drunkenness). Jesus turned water into wine at a wedding party, and Ecclesiastes 9:7 instructs, “Drink your wine with a merry heart.” Psalm 104:14-15 states that God gives wine “that makes glad the heart of men.” 

Unfortunately many who want to push Christian morality into government policy end up pushing their own brand of legalism. And the Christian leaders most willing to publicise an unbiblical message are likely to be the ones lacking the moral scrupules or common sense to question where the money for their campaign comes from.

Exactly the same tends to happen with the [emotionally charged abortion rights debate][rlc-abortion]:
[rlc-abortion]:http://www.redletterchristians.org/abortion-politically-decisive-christians-election-sin/
>Unfortunately, the abortion issue has allowed many Christians – and conservatives as a whole – to claim to be working to defend the most vulnerable when in fact they are turning attention and national resources away from those who are most desperately in need. The good that actually could be done to protect life isn’t done because pro-life Christians lend their support to politicians who are most likely to block funding for programs for children and families of the weakest and most impoverished. The abortion issue ends up serving as a smokescreen behind which certain politicians work in the interests of those who are the most rich and powerful.

Many have examined the positions they took in [the pro-life movement and found them be factually bankrupt on closer inspection][libbyanne].

When over 20 kindergarten students were killed in a mass shooting in Newtown, Conneticuit, many evangelical leaders expressed a belief that the [tragedy was a result of God's will][huffpo-sandy]. James Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family had this to say about the cause of the shooting:
[huffpo-sandy]:http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/17/james-dobson-connecticut-shooting-gay-marriage_n_2318015.html
>We have turned our back on God. millions of people have decided that God doesn't exist, or he's irrelevant to me and we have killed 54 million babies and the institution of marriage is right on the verge of a complete redefinition. Believe me, that is going to have consequences, too...
> I think we have turned our back on the Scripture and on God Almighty and I think he has allowed judgment to fall upon us. I think that’s what is going on.

Bryan Fischer, host of a popular American Family Association radio show, said on Friday that God did not protect the Sandy Hook's victims because prayer had been kicked out of public school in the '60s. Former GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said Americans should not be surprised at the tragedy because "we have sytematically removed God from our schools."

Franklin Graham, the son of Billy Graham and the CEO of the Samaritan's Purse charity said that Americans "shouldn't be shocked" at the mass murder because of violent video games and that God has been "removed" from public schools.

Sam Morris, a Tennessee pastor believes the shootings are the result of schools teaching that "humanism" means that students are God and Lanza, the serial killer "can just go blow up anybody he wants". He also said they teach [evolution and "how to be a homo"][homo-preacher]

>when you kicked God out of schools, you’re going to be judged for that.

>When I got in high school, man, I started learning all this kingdom, phylum stuff, all this junk about evolution... evolution teaches — here’s the bottom line — that you’re an animal... 

>So, here you are, you’re an animal and you’re a god! So, what are we going to teach you about in school? Well, we can teach you about sex, we can teach you how to rebel to you parents, we can teach you how to be a homo! But we’re definitely not going to teach you about the word of God! Amen.

[rlc-hook]:http://www.redletterchristians.org/sandy-hook-and-the-tearing-asunder-of-evangelical-christianity/
Blaming school shootings on God, the devil or secularism has been going on for as long as school shootings in America. After the Columbine tragedy, the father of one of the deceased had the poor judgement to state "Columbine was not just a tragedy -- it was a spiritual event" After hurricane Katrina struck, Billy Graham's daughter remarked "we've been telling God to get out of our schools, to get out of our government and to get out of our lives. And being the gentleman He is, I believe He has calmly backed out." In fact, you can be sure that Christians have been saying that "God is a gentleman" since the [tower of Siloam fell][siloam].

A number of Christians have commented on the [right wing fundamentalists that now control evangelical Christianity and their theology][rlc-hook]:
>To blame a lack of reliance on God for this most recent tragedy is a slap in the face of the victims and their families who attended church before or after the shooting... If Christians want to place blame, blame the culture of violence—not the Prince of Peace

>We do not need the government forcing us to say officially-sanctioned prayers in school each day.  Do we think being forced to say a prayer is any prayer at all?  Do we think that in the not-so-distant days of Christendom, when all members of society were considered “Christian” and our nations were “Christian,” that faith was genuine? We have come so far and need to respect the rights of other religious traditions.  We argue for freedom for our missionaries to evangelize in Islamic countries but then we want to remake America in their same restrictive mold.  Sure, today, our faith is sometimes looked down upon, marginalized, and spat on—but the church is in a much better place now that we have regained the pre-Constantinian role of sojourners in a sinful world rather than the inquisitors of godless governments.

[religion-problem]:http://www.redletterchristians.org/death-violence-and-america-is-god-the-answer-or-the-problem/
Many Christian leaders are also pointing out that ultimately the arguments about school prayer and God's will are designed to [take attention away from the discourse about effective regulations to prevent future tragedies][religion-problem].

>When American Christians are more supportive of weapons, war and torture than their unbelieving neighbors, something has gone terribly wrong. When the greatest amount of violence is found precisely in the region of the country where church membership and attendance is the highest we might ask what kind of influence Christians are exerting. Complaints about a lack of official prayer in schools or an absence of religious symbols in the public square don’t get even close to identifying the source of the violence problem.

It's common to see specious arguments claiming to know the mind of God being forwarded by hayseeders who don't understand the interests co-opting their agenda. These stooges frustratingly lack the ability to ask simple questions like, 'Is this biblical?' or 'who benefits?'. Younger Christians that question the political rhetoric of the evangelical churches they find themselves in [remain quiet about it, fearing ostracization][mclaren-evangelicals]:

>Many are afraid to admit that they voted for Barack Obama, or believe in evolution, or are concerned about global climate change, or are OK with their friends being gay or priests being married, or use birth control, or wish women could be treated as equals in their church, or don't take every word of the Bible as having equal authority and historical accuracy. If they speak up, they will be shunned by their religious authorities -- and zapped by their fellow Christians who have been told to press the punishment button when anyone dares to differ by giving the "wrong" answer. So they comply.

They comply until the evangelicals pushing an increasingly overt right wing political agenda give them more and more reasons to leave.
