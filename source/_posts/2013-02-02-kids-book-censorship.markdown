Remember when the Chaser took the piss out of the guy who said he 'cured' his homosexuality by cuddling other men and smacking pillows?
{% youtube 9z0_Jzjyi5Y %}

This dickhead is now [giving testimony to the US supreme court against marriage equality][rww-pfox], arguing homosexuality “is not an immutable characteristic". His evidence mentions that he has authored a kid's book on so-called gay "reparative therapy", called Alfie's Home. Here's how he presents it:

>Alfie's Home is the story of a boy who struggles with homosexuality well into his teenage years, then transitions naturally into heterosexuality after finding help and experiencing love in his family. This is the first resource of its kind for parents, teachers, students, counselors, clergy and anyone interested in helping children and adults heal their sexual identity.

People for the American Way, a liberal advocacy group, call the book "[the most horrifically disturbing children’s book we have ever seen][rww-pfox]". They describe the book:

>  Alfie’s Home was published in 1993 by Cohen’s International Healing Foundation. It starts out with a picture of the protagonist on a boat with his dad.  
>  ![Alfie's Home Cover](/images/Alfie-cover.jpg)
>  But it goes bad fast, going right for the right-wing myth that homosexuality is caused by childhood sexual abuse…  
>  ![Alfie's Home p6-7](/images/Alfie-6-7.jpg)
>  …and by insufficiently attentive parents:  
>  ![Alfie's Home p8-9](/images/Alfie-8-9.jpg)
>  Eventually, Alfie seeks help and takes part in the “touch therapy” advocated by Cohen…  
>  ![Alfie's Home p18-19](/images/Alfie-18-19.jpg)
>  …which leads him to “realize that I’m not gay” and start dating a woman:

I find it disturbing that they're allowed to publish this book. Especially when you consider the list of most commonly challenged books is one where [a penguin has two dads][penguin]:
