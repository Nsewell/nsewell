This week the US supreme court is assessing the contitutional validity of state laws prohibiting same-sex marriage. There is the potential to overturn California's Proposition 8, and possibly the Defence of Marriage Act. A large number of millenials have been following the SCOTUS, with many changing their profile pictures to an equality symbol. Data from Pew Research show that while other demographic groups have relativly unchanged levels of support for same-sex marriage, [17% of millenials have changed their minds over the last 3 years][pew]:

A range of significant Democratic figures have given their support to the campaign, like Hillary Clinton recently joining Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Obama himself stated his views 'evolved' from discussions with his daughters, subtley refuting the argument that gay marriage is a threat to children. A number of Republican figures like Dick Cheney, Laura Bush, and Colin Powell have already come out in support of gay marriage, and recently another 75 Republicans added their support, including [former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman and former ebay CEO Meg Whitman][repub]. Rob Portman, an original voter for DOMA, also changed his mind after [his son came out as gay][portman].

Bill O'Reilly has also [changed his view, on March 26 of the O'Reilly Factor](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2013/03/27/oreilly_gay_marriage_backers_have_compelling_argument_against_bible_thumpers.html):

> MEGYN KELLY, FOX NEWS: I mean, I think the country's views on [same-sex marriage] are changing, they're changing dramatically.
> 
> O'REILLY: But why are they changing?
> 
> KELLY: Well, because I think the same-sex marriage advocates have done a credible job in getting out there and making their case... I had an interview with Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council. What is it about calling a marriage -- calling a gay union a marriage that offends you. How does it hurt a traditional, or a heterosexual marriage? And I didn't hear anything articulated that was particularly persuasive...
> 
> O'REILLY: …I agree with you 100-percent. **The compelling argument is on the side of homosexuals**. That's where the compelling argument is. 'We're Americans, we **just want to be treated like everybody else**.'
> 
> That’s a compelling argument. And to deny that, you’ve got to have a very strong argument on the other side. And **the other side hasn’t been able to do anything but thump the Bible**.
> 
> KELLY: Their best argument, thus far, has been, 'well, marriage is an institution that for 2,000 has been about a man and a woman creating babies.'
> 
> O'REILLY: That's right.
> 
> O'REILLY: ...I live in New York, New York has [gay marriage], **I'm fine with it. I want all Americans to be happy**, I do.

With opposition to same-sex marriage seemingly in free-fall, extreme Religious Right figures are coming up with explanations for how this has happened. And rather than acknowledge that social media allows millenials to change their minds quickly, and that the demographics of the US are changing, they'd rather engage in [kooky conspiracy theories about a hidden population control agenda][wnd]:

> One has to wonder if the bigger motive behind the homosexual agenda isn’t to secretly achieve voluntary population control: Perhaps the ultimate goal is to save the planet from the inevitable destruction of man-made climate change. One could conclude that the sustainability efforts behind Agenda 21 would greatly benefit from same-sex partners who would no longer pollute the planet with the unwanted carbon footprints of tiny feet. Even those diesel-spewing school buses could become a welcomed relic of the past if enough people stopped procreating.

The idea that the gay rights movement is a covert conspiracy to destroy capitalism by reducing procreation has been picked up by Matt Hagee:

Susan Harris continues her theorising, worried about the influence that social media has over millenials:

> Chances are, if you’ve got a teenager on Facebook, they have been lured by curiosity to at least one of these sites. In addition to social media, well-known gay celebrities in comedy, news and music beat a steady drumbeat of tantalizing homosexual ideology for America’s youth…
> 
> Generation Q lives and breathes an intense obsession of their sexuality that is disturbing to outsiders. Insiders include gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transgenders, pansexuals and basically everyone who does not adhere to the archaic idea of a man and woman being attracted to each other, marrying and having children. More importantly, it consists of allies who loudly champion the cause for family and friends already immersed in this destructive culture…
> 
> We have reached the point where neither American laws nor accepted cultural norms will protect my rights as a Christian to protect my child from what my faith teaches is sinful and perverse behavior. Americans must not back down in the face of constant intimidation. The first step begins at home: naming the sin and teaching our children to love the sinner but hate the sin. **The LGBT agenda is ensuring that our tiny tots are taught homosexuality before we’ve even broken them of thumb-sucking**. By the time they are teenagers – feeling “different” like millions of teenagers before them – they are being sucked into the LGBTQ lifestyle because their parents and their communities put acceptance of man’s lusts above God’s law.
> 
> Our youth are embarking on a lonely, dark path of sexual confusion and its resulting sadness, disease and suicide. There will be no going back. Generation Q may have already slipped through our fingers.

Clearly the only sane thing a God-fearing parent can do is to keep their tiny tots holed up in a basement for the first decade of life, away from the corrupting influence of the world.

Behind the claim that gays want to destroy capitalism is the concern that changing social mores and cultural norms, as well as efforts to reduce economic inequality will [destroy the Religious Right](http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/paul07/paul07_index.html).
