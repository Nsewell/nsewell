John Dickson's [stirring up some trouble by suggesting that women should be allowed to preach in church][dickson]. The idea that evangelicals are still discussing this in the 21st centuary is patently ridiculous, but Dickson is stepping in to offer a biblical basis for letting women preach modern sermons without becoming priests. His argument is that if Paul's prohibition on permitting women to teach men authoritatively does not prohibit exortation or prophesy. The word 'didaskos' (from learning, as in autodidact) is used by Paul with high specificity of 'guarding the apostolic deposit', therefore it is unclear what level of teaching women are prevented from performing. The crux is that most modern sermons have some teaching and some exhortation. Michael Jensen warns against 'theologising our traditions', but the book has provoked a small backlash (more of a whimper than a bang).

When Johannes Gutenberg created the printing press he had many things to say about its ability to spread orthodoxy thoughout the world.
>It is a press, certainly, but a press from which shall flow in inexhaustible streams...Through it, God will spread His Word. A spring of truth shall flow from it: like a new star it shall scatter the darkness of ignorance, and cause a light heretofore unknown to shine amongst men.

>God suffers in the multitude of souls whom His word can not reach. Religious truth is imprisoned in a small number of manuscript books which confine instead of spread the public treasure. Let us break the seal which seals up holy things and give wings to Truth in order that she may win every soul that comes into the world by her word no longer written at great expense by hands easily palsied, but multiplied like the wind by an untiring machine.

The printing press wasn't just used to print bibles, it was used to print [Luther's 95 Theses][luther]. What was thesis 90?
>90. To repress these arguments and scruples of the laity by force alone, and not to resolve them by giving reasons, is to expose the Church and the pope to the ridicule of their enemies, and to make Christians unhappy.

And how do people [respond to John Dickson][amzn]?
>This book does not line up with scriptural truth, so that is why I give it the lowest rating. I would say it is full of "thumb sucking theology" - where the writer "sucks it out of his thumb" because he has to; there is not sound biblical support for his view. Reject this. Discard it, no matter how well it might be written.

Some others have suggested that the layity should not be allowed to have access to the secret knowledge of Greek and Hebrew, because, then how will they understand English words in their bible? This painfully naive argument overlooks the reality of changing communications technology and how that will inevitably change the way the laity interacts with the church. It also ignores that bible translations satisfy a political agenda - case in point, the KJV has only 2 instances of the word 'slave'

In fact, King James [authorised his version because he found the marginal notes in the Geneva translation offensive][james], praising the civil disobedience of the Hebrew midwives in Exodus 1:19. The king also gave the translators instructions designed to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology of the Church of England.

"I don't like what this author has to say so I don't want anyone to read it" stopped working in 1517, but evangelicals keep trying these counterproductive "[Farewell, Rob Bell][bell]" hatchet jobs.
>Rob Bell now stands alongside a growing pantheon of brothers in Christ -- Greg Boyd, Brian McLaren and N.T. Wright among them -- who Piper has thrown under the bus (and even called "heretics") simply because their theology doesn't neatly jibe with his own.

>For a generation harboring increasingly negative perceptions about (and distancing itself from) Christianity, there's no question that controversies like these have played a big role in making these trends worse. When asked to describe present-day Christianity, the second most reported description of young people (ages 16 to 29) was that it is "too-judgmental," with 87 percent of young non-churchgoers and 52 percent of churchgoers holding this view.

When Rachel Held evans was writing a book on feminism, [she was asked to drop the two references to the word vagina to appease Lifeway][vagomatic]. Lifeway are the bookstore arm of the [Southern Baptist Convention, an evangelical group set up over slave-holding rights][sbc], so good luck publishing a book saying that if Christians don't take stoning non-virgins to death on their wedding night seriously, maybe [dumb ideas about women baking][driscoll-fuckwit1] [need to die out][driscoll-fuckwit2] [as well][driscoll-hell]. Despite the book not being listed by lifeway, A Year of Biblical Womanhood made it onto the [New York Times top 18th e-book bestseller][nyt-vag]. A clear victory for vaginas everywhere, and a defeat for those that want to censor Christianity into decrepitude with outdated ideas about book buying.

The saddest thing about the issue is how much Dickson is not saying. What's it going to be, another 10 years of Sydney Anglicans dragging their feet on women in any real ministry roles? Yes, that's right, I said real; get used to it. If you can't confront the reality that the current situation is actually shitty for women you won't be able to confront the reality that Sydney Anglicans will be a [vestige of its former glory][ncls]. And I'm not sure what to think about it.
