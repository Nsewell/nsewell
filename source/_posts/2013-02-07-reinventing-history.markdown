>There is a funny thing about history. Even though there are countless books waiting to be investigated and read, myriad articles from the times, and an abundance of other evidence, we human beings would rather have someone else — one of our contemporaries — tell us what it is.

This is why, as George Orwell opined in *Ninteen Eighty Four*, "whoever controls the present controls the past".

It's become common to hear right wing Christians insist that the US was founded on Christian values.

The right wing agenda is attempting to broaden their base to black and latino Christians, requiring that they give lipservice to civil rights issues.

>“Although various Roman Catholic groups denounced the ruling, and Christianity Today complained that the Roe decision “runs counter to the moral teachings of Christianity through the ages but also to the moral sense of the American people,” the vast majority of evangelical leaders said virtually nothing about it; many of those who did comment actually applauded the decision. W. Barry Garrett of Baptist Press wrote, “Religious liberty, human equality and justice are advanced by the Supreme Court abortion decision.” Indeed, even before the Roe decision, the messengers (delegates) to the 1971 Southern Baptist Convention gathering in St. Louis, Missouri, adopted a resolution that stated, “we call upon Southern Baptists to work for legislation that will allow the possibility of abortion under such conditions as rape, incest, clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother.” W.A. Criswell, former president of the Southern Baptist Convention and pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas, expressed his satisfaction with the Roe v. Wade ruling. “I have always felt that it was only after a child was born and had a life separate from its mother that it became an individual person,” the redoubtable fundamentalist declared, “and it has always, therefore, seemed to me that what is best for the mother and for the future should be allowed.”

Many Right wing 

Right-winger Paul Weyrich of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress said:
“What galvanised the Christian community was not abortion, school prayer, or the ERA. I am living witness to that because I was trying to get those people interested in those issues and I utterly failed. What changed their mind was Jimmy Carter’s intervention against the Christian schools, trying to deny them tax-exempt status on the basis of so-called de-facto segregation.”

Christian Post homosexuality change
Christians who see homosexuality as wrong ?
54% November 2011
39% November 2012

Is it because hollywood is pushing a campaign
Is it because political correctness is popular?
Is it because the media has exposed how, if evangelicals had their way, Homosexuality would have the death penalty.
