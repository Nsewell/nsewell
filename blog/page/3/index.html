  <div class="entry-content"><p>Quentin Tarantino&#8217;s latest spaghetti western and blaxploitation inspired film. QT takes on the brutality of the slave culture in the antebellum South as he did the Holocaust in <strong>Inglorious Basterds</strong>. Christoph Waltz played a German in both films, giving a much more convincing performance in Django as Dr Shultz, a bounty hunter who hates slavers. Through his partnership with freed slave Django (Jamie Foxx) they go on a blood soaked rampage for justice and vengeance. Ebert calls the ending a &#8220;satisfactory Quentonian celebration of violence&#8221;. Django has been criticised for excessive on-screen violence and a release date two weeks from the Conneticuit mass murder. Of course this is a <a href="/blog/2013/01/20/rick-perry/">standard diversionary tactic against real political action</a>. QT&#8217;s use of grindhouse storytelling leaves moralisers in a panic and fans and critics expressing strong approval in a measured fashion. Tarantino has also come under fire for the script&#8217;s frequent use of the n-word, which <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-jamie-foxx-django-unchained-n-word-leonardo-dicaprio-20121220,0,2556146.story">the actors found uncomfortable</a>. QT tackles the heavy subject of slavery without succumbing to moralising, creating entertainment (with unexpectedly humorous scenes) for a wide audience. And in some ways, that&#8217;s probably why conservatives hate it.</p>

<p>Throughout film history audiences have been influenced by abridged accounts of historical events. Discussing <strong>Battleship Potemkin</strong>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battleship_Potemkin#The_Odessa_Steps_sequence">Roger Ebert writes</a>,</p>

<blockquote><p>That there was, in fact, no czarist massacre on the Odessa Steps scarcely diminishes the power of the scene &#8230; It is ironic that [Eisenstein] did it so well that today, the bloodshed on the Odessa steps is often referred to as if it really happened.</p></blockquote>

<p>There&#8217;s been a strong critic reaction to <strong>Zero Dark Thirty</strong> with its positive portrayal of &#8220;enhanced interrogation techniques&#8221;, with an ex-CIA official calling the movie <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2013/jan/14/oscars-boycott-zero-dark-thirty">an &#8220;infomercial&#8221; for their techniques</a>. The film does not explicitly say that torture helped to gain information to capture Bin Laden, it only makes that suggestion by designating half an hour at the start of the film to interrogations. Even people who know that no information was gained on Bin Laden through torture, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/01/zero-dark-thirty-debate-torture-has-no-place-in-a-civilized-society/">presenting it as a standard part of a modern intelligence operation is morally dubious</a>.</p>

<p>The history shows not only did torture fail to produce useful information other than what was already gained without using &#8220;enhanced&#8221; techniques, faulty information <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/23/opinion/la-oe-1223-mcdermott-torture-bigelow-zero-dark-20121223">sent the CIA on a wild goose chase</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The simple fact is you can&#8217;t reliably separate the gold from the dross that torture yields. &#8220;He had us chasing the goddamn geese in Central Park because he said some of them had explosives stuffed up their ass,&#8221; one FBI counter-terrorism agent said in frustration</p></blockquote>

<p>Audiences of historical fiction should be mindful that the presentation of events they see may have little to do with actual history. When one of Django&#8217;s characters, the ugly, sadistic Big John Brittle starts whipping a black slave girl for breaking eggs while holding a bible in his left hand and recounting scripture, I was dubious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction#Jules.27s_Bible_passage">given Tarantino&#8217;s history of making up bible passages</a>. Lo and behold, the text of the bible passage is accurate, Genesis 9:2 &#8220;The fear of ye, and the dread of ye, shall be on every beast of the Earth&#8221;. Some have questioned whether Tarantino, an atheist, is laying it on a bit thick by with Brittle having three pages from the bible sewn to his clothes while being an outlaw wanted dead or alive.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/dj-145.jpeg" title="Big John Brittle shot in Django Unchained" ></p>

<p>But really, considering the context, this isn&#8217;t pantomime at all. Students of the pseudoscience of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology">phrenology</a> considered the brains of Europeans the &#8220;most beautiful&#8221; when compared to &#8220;lesser&#8221; races, as blacks lacked the part of the brain capable of producing artists. Considering Genesis 9, the biblical account of the result of Yahweh&#8217;s global flood is that the world must be repopulated from Noah&#8217;s descendents, Shem, Ham and Japeth.</p>

<blockquote><p> Noah, a man of the soil, began to plant a vineyard. <em>21</em> When he drank some of the wine, he got drunk and uncovered himself inside his tent. <em>22</em> Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father&#8217;s nakedness and told his two brothers who were outside. <em>23</em> Shem and Japheth took the garment and placed it on their shoulders. Then they walked in backwards and covered up their father&#8217;s nakedness. Their faces were turned the other way so they did not see their father&#8217;s nakedness.</p>

<p> 24 When Noah awoke from his drunken stupor he learned what his youngest son had done to him. 25 So he said,</p>

<p> &#8220;Cursed be Canaan!<br/>
 The lowest of slaves<br/>
 he will be to his brothers.&#8221; <br/>
 26 He also said,</p>

<p> &#8220;Worthy of praise is the LORD, the God of Shem! <br/>
 May Canaan be the slave of Shem!<br/>
 27 May God enlarge Japheth&#8217;s territory and numbers!<br/>
 May he live in the tents of Shem <br/>
 and may Canaan be his slave!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>And so because Ham didn&#8217;t cover up his father&#8217;s nakedness, instead left his father&#8217;s tent to tell his brothers and laugh at his father (and possibly bring out Noah&#8217;s garment to show his brothers, before they honourably bring back &#8220;the garment&#8221;) all of Ham&#8217;s descendants are cursed to be the <strong>עֶבֶד עֲבָדִים eved avadim</strong>, the lowest of slaves. The curse is pronounced on Canaan, not Ham.</p>

<p>While Genesis 9 only mentiones the Canaanites (Phoenecia/Palestine) as the people group under the curse of slavery from Ham, Genesis 10:6 also mentions the Cush (Nubia/Ethiopia), Mizraim (Egypt) and Put (Libya). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Ham">Traditional Christian understanding asserts that Japheth went on to father the people group that became Western Europeans and Caucasians</a>. Therefore this simplistic literal understanding of Genesis has been used for generations to support the idea that black people were under a curse from God to serve the white people as slaves. Unfortunately this is <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/texas-public-school-course-teaches-racial-origins-traced-noah">still being taught as gospel in Southern public schools</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/RacialOriginsNoah.jpg" title="Racial Origins from Noah's Decendents" ></p>

<p>The belief that African people are born to serve Caucasians as the &#8216;lowest of slaves&#8217; is alive and well in Texas. How do these types respond to the film? <a href="http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2012/12/12/the-conservative-backlash-against-django-unchained-began-today">With widespread admiration, of course</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Django Unchained is hard-core Cultural Marxism. Supporters of this doctrine believe that the best way to get the American public to accept Marxism and Totalitarianism is to denigrate, defame, and ridicule Western Civilization, moral values, Christianity, and the family unit. It was devised by the Frankfurt School in the 1930s.</p>

<p>The movie is being released on Christmas Day as a way of denigrating Christmas and the Christian faith.</p>

<p>Jamie Foxx, the star of Django Unchained is promoting the movie by going on anti-white racial rants in public. This weekend, on Saturday Night Live, he stated “I get to kill all the white people, how great is that!”</p></blockquote>

<p>Other than slavery being banned in the South, the only thing that seems to have changed is that now they have to call heroic black figures &#8216;socialist&#8217; when in public. I bet they&#8217;ll love the next 4 years.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>John Dickson&#8217;s <a href="http://sydneyanglicans.net/blogs/culture/a-surprising-consensus">stirring up some trouble by suggesting that women should be allowed to preach in church</a>. The idea that evangelicals are still discussing this in the 21st centuary is patently ridiculous, but Dickson is stepping in to offer a biblical basis for letting women preach modern sermons without becoming priests. His argument is that if Paul&#8217;s prohibition on permitting women to teach men authoritatively does not prohibit exortation or prophesy. The word &#8216;didaskos&#8217; (from learning, as in autodidact) is used by Paul with high specificity of &#8216;guarding the apostolic deposit&#8217;, therefore it is unclear what level of teaching women are prevented from performing. The crux is that most modern sermons have some teaching and some exhortation. Michael Jensen warns against &#8216;theologising our traditions&#8217;, but the book has provoked a small backlash (more of a whimper than a bang).</p>

<p>When Johannes Gutenberg created the printing press he had many things to say about its ability to spread orthodoxy thoughout the world.</p>

<blockquote><p>It is a press, certainly, but a press from which shall flow in inexhaustible streams&#8230;Through it, God will spread His Word. A spring of truth shall flow from it: like a new star it shall scatter the darkness of ignorance, and cause a light heretofore unknown to shine amongst men.</p>

<p>God suffers in the multitude of souls whom His word can not reach. Religious truth is imprisoned in a small number of manuscript books which confine instead of spread the public treasure. Let us break the seal which seals up holy things and give wings to Truth in order that she may win every soul that comes into the world by her word no longer written at great expense by hands easily palsied, but multiplied like the wind by an untiring machine.</p></blockquote>

<p>The printing press wasn&#8217;t just used to print bibles, it was used to print <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/274/pg274.html">Luther&#8217;s 95 Theses</a>. What was thesis 90?</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>To repress these arguments and scruples of the laity by force alone, and not to resolve them by giving reasons, is to expose the Church and the pope to the ridicule of their enemies, and to make Christians unhappy.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>And how do people <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T1RLYJM4U3TV">respond to John Dickson</a>?</p>

<blockquote><p>This book does not line up with scriptural truth, so that is why I give it the lowest rating. I would say it is full of &#8220;thumb sucking theology&#8221; - where the writer &#8220;sucks it out of his thumb&#8221; because he has to; there is not sound biblical support for his view. Reject this. Discard it, no matter how well it might be written.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some others have suggested that the layity should not be allowed to have access to the secret knowledge of Greek and Hebrew, because, then how will they understand English words in their bible? This painfully naive argument overlooks the reality of changing communications technology and how that will inevitably change the way the laity interacts with the church. It also ignores that bible translations satisfy a political agenda - case in point, the KJV has only 2 instances of the word &#8216;slave&#8217;</p>

<p>In fact, King James <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorized_King_James_Version#Considerations_for_a_new_version">authorised his version because he found the marginal notes in the Geneva translation offensive</a>, praising the civil disobedience of the Hebrew midwives in Exodus 1:19. The king also gave the translators instructions designed to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology of the Church of England.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like what this author has to say so I don&#8217;t want anyone to read it&#8221; stopped working in 1517, but evangelicals keep trying these counterproductive &#8221;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-latondresse/farewell-rob-bell-or-john_b_829409.html">Farewell, Rob Bell</a>&#8221; hatchet jobs.</p>

<blockquote><p>Rob Bell now stands alongside a growing pantheon of brothers in Christ &#8211; Greg Boyd, Brian McLaren and N.T. Wright among them &#8211; who Piper has thrown under the bus (and even called &#8220;heretics&#8221;) simply because their theology doesn&#8217;t neatly jibe with his own.</p>

<p>For a generation harboring increasingly negative perceptions about (and distancing itself from) Christianity, there&#8217;s no question that controversies like these have played a big role in making these trends worse. When asked to describe present-day Christianity, the second most reported description of young people (ages 16 to 29) was that it is &#8220;too-judgmental,&#8221; with 87 percent of young non-churchgoers and 52 percent of churchgoers holding this view.</p></blockquote>

<p>When Rachel Held evans was writing a book on feminism, <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/on-rachel-held-evans-and-why-vagina-gate-matters/">she was asked to drop the two references to the word vagina to appease Lifeway</a>. Lifeway are the bookstore arm of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention">Southern Baptist Convention, an evangelical group set up over slave-holding rights</a>, so good luck publishing a book saying that if Christians don&#8217;t take stoning non-virgins to death on their wedding night seriously, maybe <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/unreasonablefaith/2011/07/thoughts-on-driscoll/">dumb ideas about women baking</a> <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2013/01/mark-driscoll-on-stay-at-home-dads.html">need to die out</a> <a href="http://www.nakedpastor.com/2012/01/17/mark-driscoll-in-hell/">as well</a>. Despite the book not being listed by lifeway, A Year of Biblical Womanhood made it onto the <a href="http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/why-a-year-of-biblical-womanhood-is-a-nyt-bestseller">New York Times top 18th e-book bestseller</a>. A clear victory for vaginas everywhere, and a defeat for those that want to censor Christianity into decrepitude with outdated ideas about book buying.</p>

<p>The saddest thing about the issue is how much Dickson is not saying. What&#8217;s it going to be, another 10 years of Sydney Anglicans dragging their feet on women in any real ministry roles? Yes, that&#8217;s right, I said real; get used to it. If you can&#8217;t confront the reality that the current situation is actually shitty for women you won&#8217;t be able to confront the reality that Sydney Anglicans will be a <a href="/blog/2012/12/07/ncls2011">vestige of its former glory</a>. And I&#8217;m not sure what to think about it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rick Perry, governer of Texas has come out against gun control, suggesting to Christians that <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/50484736/ns/local_news-dallas_fort_worth_tx/t/gov-rick-perry-responds-obama-gun-control-order/#.UPkB8dc-vZg">prayer works better than gun control</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p> Guns require a finger to pull the trigger. The sad young man who did that in Newtown was clearly haunted by demons and no gun law could have saved the children in Sandy Hook Elementary from his terror.</p>

<p> There is evil prowling in the world – it shows up in our movies, video games and online fascinations, and finds its way into vulnerable hearts and minds. As a free people, let us choose what kind of people we will be.  Laws, the only redoubt of secularism, will not suffice.  Let us all return to our places of worship and pray for help. Above all, let us pray for our children.</p>

<p> In fact, the piling on by the political left, and their cohorts in the media, to use the massacre of little children to advance a pre-existing political agenda that would not have saved those children, disgusts me, personally.  The second amendment to the Constitution is a basic right of free people and cannot be nor will it be abridged by the executive power of this or any other president.</p></blockquote>

<p>Perry claims that &#8220;no gun law could have saved the children in Sandy Hook Elementary from his terror&#8221;. Even if the killer Lanza was possessed by a demon, gun laws do indeed save lives. On the same day as the Sandy Hook killings, a mentally ill man in the Chinese provence of Guanxi <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/15/not-just-sandy-hook-china-s-terrifying-knife-attacks.html">wounded 22 children in a school stabbing rampage</a>. All of the children survived. To say that gun laws have no effect is nonsense, and the Chinese example proves that it is easier to eliminate firearms in a society than mental health issues.</p>

<p>If Rick Perry believes that laws are a &#8220;redoubt of secularism&#8221; then we must ask, what is the function of the governor of a state other than to create laws to make her citizens safe and prosperous? If it is to call citizens to &#8220;pray for help&#8221;, I think he&#8217;s confused the state for the church. A common mistake among born-again Christians these days.</p>

<p>To blame a lack of prayer reliance on God for these tragedies is a slap in the face of the victims and their families who attended church before or after the shooting. In fact, religion may be more a part of the <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/death-violence-and-america-is-god-the-answer-or-the-problem/">problem of violence than the solution</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>When American Christians are more supportive of weapons, war and torture than their unbelieving neighbors, something has gone terribly wrong. When the greatest amount of violence is found precisely in the region of the country where church membership and attendance is the highest we might ask what kind of influence Christians are exerting. Complaints about a lack of official prayer in schools or an absence of religious symbols in the public square don’t get even close to identifying the source of the violence problem.</p></blockquote>

<p>Rather than discussing real solutions to mental health issues, Perry goes on to blame the entertainment industry and &#8220;evil prowling in the world&#8221;. Violent video games and movies have long been criticized for inspiring murders. After the 1999 mass murder in Columbine, Franklin Graham commented that the <a href="http://extras.denverpost.com/news/chs0416p.htm">tragedy has strengthened his belief that guns aren&#8217;t to blame for gun violence</a>. Rather, Graham said that the entertainment industry is &#8220;awash in killings, shootings and rapes. We are complete fools if we don&#8217;t think that today&#8217;s entertainment has poisoned a generation. I&#8217;ve always believed this but I believe it more now.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is a smattering of research showing a tenuous correlation between violent media and anti-social behaviour, but there is no proof of causation. Given that the entertainment industry has most of their products protected under free speech rights in the First Amendment to the US Constitution, it&#8217;s dissapointing that the governor has not sought genuine solutions 13 years on.</p>

<p><img src="/images/nakedpastor-guns.jpg" title="&#34;Guns and Peace by David Hayward of NakedPastor.com&#34;" alt="&#34;Guns and Peace by David Hayward of NakedPastor.com&#34;"></p>

<p>The abuse of religion by the far right in America is a phenomenon that is drawing more and more negative attention. When evangelical leaders called school shootings <a href="/blog/2013/01/03/rentier-theology/">god&#8217;s will</a> many Christians cautiously distance themselves. Unfortunately while some have downplayed the significance of <a href="http://www.outofur.com/archives/2013/01/no_were_not_a_h.html">a few &#8220;crazy uncles&#8221; and insist that mainstream Christianity is not a hate group</a>, Perry joining the chorus is not going to help.</p>

<p>Albert Mohler described the Republican loss of the 2012 presidential race as an &#8221;<a href="http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/real-evangelical-disaster">evangelical disaster</a>&#8221;. Rachel Held Evans responded that &#8220;the great evangelical disaster is that evangelicalism has become synonymous with Republicanism rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ.&#8221; Gun control measures like <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2013/01/14/in-gun-control-debate-several-options-draw-majority-support/">universal background checks supported by 85% of Republicans</a>. I&#8217;d say that the real disaster is that evangelicalism is being used as an excuse, or worse, as a justification to push political inaction on something the majority of the country wants because the NRA is lining their pockets. If Christians don&#8217;t change their trajectory, I don&#8217;t think there will be much of a church left in another 13 years. And the only explanation they&#8217;ll have for it is to blame violent video games for &#8220;corrupting the youth&#8221;.</p>

</a>
<div class="video-info" >http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/fischer-natural-disasters-are-gods-spankings

Bryan Fischer explains that natural disasters are God&#8217;s way of getting our attention and correcting us, like chidlren who need a spaking.</div>
</div>


<p>I guess someone had better tell Jesus, he seems to have gotten his theology wrong in Luke 13:</p>

<blockquote><p>There were some present at that very time who told him about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. <em>2</em> And he answered them, “Do you think that these Galileans were worse sinners than all the other Galileans, because they suffered in this way? <em>3</em> No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish. <em>4</em> Or those eighteen on whom the tower in Siloam fell and killed them: do you think that they were worse offenders than all the others who lived in Jerusalem? <em>5</em> No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all likewise perish.”</p></blockquote>

<p>With Cindy Jacobs getting new prophesy all the time, of course Jesus would need to update some of his more old hat ideas. And Fisher should probably tell Job who seems to make a fuss about his friends rightly criticising him for his slapping:</p>

<blockquote><p> 2 &#8220;I have heard many things like these before.   <br/>
 What miserable comforters are you all! <br/>
 3 Will there be an end to your windy words?<br/>
 Or what provokes you that you answer?  <br/>
 4 I also could speak like you, <br/>
 if you were in my place; <br/>
 I could pile up words against you <br/>
 and I could shake my head at you. <br/>
 5 But I would strengthen you with my words; <br/>
 comfort from my lips would bring you relief.</p></blockquote>

<p>What a whiny peter pan man-boy. He must not have been given enough discipline in public schools, now all he has is an entitlement culture. Guess we&#8217;ll just have to write off the mind of another youth after the softness of &#8216;developmental psychology&#8217; turned it to much. We see this with his complete disrespect for the scriptural knowledge of his betters</p>

<blockquote><p> Job 15:8: Do you listen in on God&#8217;s secret council? Do you limit wisdom to yourself? <br/>
 Job 15:9: What do you know that we don&#8217;t know? What do you understand that we don&#8217;t understand? <br/>
 Job 15:10: The gray-haired and the aged are on our side, men far older than your father. <br/>
 Job 15:11: Are God&#8217;s consolations too trivial for you; or a word spoken in gentleness to you?</p></blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately &#8220;sin inspires his mouth; he chooses the language of the crafty&#8221; because he just wants to sin and do whatever he wants, just like a standard drug-addled liberal. Of course he doesn&#8217;t recognise God&#8217;s wisdom when we give it to him.</p>

<p>Now there is a liberal hoax that <strong>claims</strong> that this man is &#8220;blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil&#8221;. But really, have you seen the <em>long form</em> of his birth certificate? I didn&#8217;t think so. Stick it on the pile with climate change, heliocentrism and the germ theory of disease. Pfft, those scientists and their <strong>theories</strong>. You can&#8217;t trust theories when it comes to life and death.</p>

<p>Similarly someone should tell Yahweh as well (just in case Jesus forgot to pass it on to himself) - clearly God was meant to punish Job, not the miserable comforters that rightly point out Job&#8217;s sin causing all these natural disasters to be brought on himself. Their message might not be popular, but it sure is &#8216;biblical&#8217; (in a sense), and they should be praised for preaching it boldly.</p>

<blockquote><p> Job 42:7: After the LORD had spoken these things to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite, &#8220;My anger is stirred up against you and your two friends, because you have not spoken about me what is right, as my servant Job has.<br/>
 Job 42:8: So now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and offer a burnt offering for yourselves. And my servant Job will intercede for you, and I will respect him, so that I do not deal with you according to your folly, because you have not spoken about me what is right, as my servant Job has.&#8221; <br/>
 Job 42:9: So they went, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and did just as the LORD had told them; and the LORD had respect for Job.</p></blockquote>

<p>Geez, this socialist seems to be engaging in class warfare.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s common to hear right wing editorials and chain letters advancing arguments to the effect that if society only did X (like they did in the &#8220;good old days&#8221;) then every social ill would be cured. This commonly plays on misconceptions based on alarmist media reports that <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/150464/Americans-Believe-Crime-Worsening.aspx">violence in Western societies is getting worse</a> while in reality violent crime <a href="http://edge.org/conversation/mc2011-history-violence-pinker">is at the lowest levels ever thoughout the West</a>.</p>

<p>Many people think that <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2012/s3511023.htm">crime in the Australia is worsening</a>, and that the majority of crime involves violence. Unfortunately, the media frequently presents <a href="http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/Lawlink/bocsar/ll_bocsar.nsf/vwFiles/CJB153.pdf/$file/CJB153.pdf">misleading commentary on crime figures</a>, suggesting that small localised variations in crime rates are indicitive of a trend towards mayhem and chaos. This has lead to an evaporation of public confidence in the <a href="http://aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/tandi/381-400/tandi387/view%20paper.html">ability for the criminal justice system to deal with crime fairly and adequately</a>. A study of Tasmanian jurors found that while 80% of the public believe that courts are too lenient in sentencing, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/1128_aic.pdf">90% of of jurors informed on information about crime cases thought that the judge in the case gave an adequate sentence</a>.</p>

<p>Despite the reality that courts are generally in line with Australian expectations on crime sentencing, misinformed conservatives are pushing in various states for mandatory minimum sentences, based on the idea that politicians, pundits and focus groups know more about how to deal with crime than lawyers, academics and judges. These policies would <a href="http://newmatilda.com/2012/07/13/campbells-tick-and-flick-government">dramatically increase the prison population</a>, putting pressure on the public corrections system to build more prisons. Private prison companies would likely be commissioned to increase prisons capacity at lower cost. But as <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/08/private_prisons">The Economist warns</a>, &#8220;The great hazard of contracting out incarceration &#8220;services&#8221; is that private firms may well turn out to be even more efficient and effective than unions in lobbying for policies that would increase prison populations.&#8221;</p>

<p>This has indeed happend in America, not just with prisons lobbying government to maintain &#8220;demand&#8221; for their services, but directly <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/06/matt-stoller-who-wants-keep-the-war-on-drugs-going-and-put-you-in-debtors-prison.html">bribing judges to increase the sentences for offenders</a>. The for profit prisons industry is concerned that &#8220;any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them.&#8221; They also list good policing as a risk to their business: &#8220;reductions in crime rates or resources dedicated to prevent and enforce crime could lead to reductions in arrests, convictions and sentences requiring incarceration at correctional facilities.&#8221; As the saying goes, if you&#8217;re not part of the solution, prolong the problem for as long as possible.</p>

<p>The next time you hear a conservative pundit decrying the &#8220;softness&#8221; of judges and insisting on &#8220;tough on crime&#8221; policies you should ask yourself: &#8220;is this supported by the evidence?&#8221; And if not, what&#8217;s behind this? Who benefits? Is it simply incompetence or is it malice? Is it just yellow journalism to sell tabloids or is there an economic incentive in perpetuating the misinformation that violent crime is on the rise, or that current drug policy is working?</p>

<p>Often those pushing a conservative moral argument <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootleggers_and_Baptists">have no idea where their financial backing comes from</a>. Politics makes for strange bedfellows, with polticians often acting as a go-between with conservative moralisers and those with a financial agenda. During the prohibition era, Baptists were known to ally in their support of alcohol bans with bootleggers that profited from them. The preachers wanted to ban alcohol so that church wouldn&#8217;t compete with pubs on the &#8220;Lord&#8217;s day&#8221;. The bootleggers wanted their monopoly on the sale of alcohol. It leads to faulty theology like this, a billboard encouraging voters in a dry town not to legalise the sale of alcohol, saying that a vote for legal alcohol is a re-crucifixion of Jesus.
<img src="../images/BaptistsAndBootleggers.jpg" title="Baptists and Bootleggers" alt="Baptists and Bootleggers" /></p>

<p>A minor problem with this sign is that it&#8217;s not only hysterical, it&#8217;s completely unbiblical. The sign references Hebrews 10:29, which warns that church-goers who &#8220;deliberately keep on sinning&#8221; can be guilty of re-crucifying Jesus drink communion wine in an unworthy manner (&#8220;profaning the blood of the covenant&#8221;). To say that this prohibits the sale of alcohol for non-religious consumption is a misapplication of scripture. Most Christian denominations support the moderate consumption of alcohol (but condemn drunkenness). Jesus turned water into wine at a wedding party, and Ecclesiastes 9:7 instructs, “Drink your wine with a merry heart.” Psalm 104:14-15 states that God gives wine “that makes glad the heart of men.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately many who want to push Christian morality into government policy end up pushing their own brand of legalism. And the Christian leaders most willing to publicise an unbiblical message are likely to be the ones lacking the moral scrupules or common sense to question where the money for their campaign comes from.</p>

<p>Exactly the same tends to happen with the <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/abortion-politically-decisive-christians-election-sin/">emotionally charged abortion rights debate</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, the abortion issue has allowed many Christians – and conservatives as a whole – to claim to be working to defend the most vulnerable when in fact they are turning attention and national resources away from those who are most desperately in need. The good that actually could be done to protect life isn’t done because pro-life Christians lend their support to politicians who are most likely to block funding for programs for children and families of the weakest and most impoverished. The abortion issue ends up serving as a smokescreen behind which certain politicians work in the interests of those who are the most rich and powerful.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many have examined the positions they took in <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2012/10/how-i-lost-faith-in-the-pro-life-movement.html">the pro-life movement and found them be factually bankrupt on closer inspection</a>.</p>

<p>When over 20 kindergarten students were killed in a mass shooting in Newtown, Conneticuit, many evangelical leaders expressed a belief that the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/17/james-dobson-connecticut-shooting-gay-marriage_n_2318015.html">tragedy was a result of God&#8217;s will</a>. James Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family had this to say about the cause of the shooting:</p>

<blockquote><p>We have turned our back on God. millions of people have decided that God doesn&#8217;t exist, or he&#8217;s irrelevant to me and we have killed 54 million babies and the institution of marriage is right on the verge of a complete redefinition. Believe me, that is going to have consequences, too&#8230;
I think we have turned our back on the Scripture and on God Almighty and I think he has allowed judgment to fall upon us. I think that’s what is going on.</p></blockquote>

<p>Bryan Fischer, host of a popular American Family Association radio show, said on Friday that God did not protect the Sandy Hook&#8217;s victims because prayer had been kicked out of public school in the &#8217;60s. Former GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said Americans should not be surprised at the tragedy because &#8220;we have sytematically removed God from our schools.&#8221;</p>

<p>Franklin Graham, the son of Billy Graham and the CEO of the Samaritan&#8217;s Purse charity said that Americans &#8220;shouldn&#8217;t be shocked&#8221; at the mass murder because of violent video games and that God has been &#8220;removed&#8221; from public schools.</p>

Franklin Graham blames the Sandy Hook massacre on television, music, video games, and the removal of God from public school.</div>
</div>


<p>Sam Morris, a Tennessee pastor believes the shootings are the result of schools teaching that &#8220;humanism&#8221; means that students are God and Lanza, the serial killer &#8220;can just go blow up anybody he wants&#8221;. He also said they teach <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/12/17/tennessee-pastor-mass-shootings-because-schools-teach-evolution-and-how-to-be-a-homo/">evolution and &#8220;how to be a homo&#8221;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>when you kicked God out of schools, you’re going to be judged for that.</p>

<p>When I got in high school, man, I started learning all this kingdom, phylum stuff, all this junk about evolution&#8230; evolution teaches — here’s the bottom line — that you’re an animal&#8230;</p>

<p>So, here you are, you’re an animal and you’re a god! So, what are we going to teach you about in school? Well, we can teach you about sex, we can teach you how to rebel to you parents, we can teach you how to be a homo! But we’re definitely not going to teach you about the word of God! Amen.</p></blockquote>

<p>Blaming school shootings on God, the devil or secularism has been going on for as long as school shootings in America. After the Columbine tragedy, the father of one of the deceased had the poor judgement to state &#8220;Columbine was not just a tragedy &#8211; it was a spiritual event&#8221; After hurricane Katrina struck, Billy Graham&#8217;s daughter remarked &#8220;we&#8217;ve been telling God to get out of our schools, to get out of our government and to get out of our lives. And being the gentleman He is, I believe He has calmly backed out.&#8221; In fact, you can be sure that Christians have been saying that &#8220;God is a gentleman&#8221; since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Siloam">tower of Siloam fell</a>.</p>

<p>A number of Christians have commented on the <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/sandy-hook-and-the-tearing-asunder-of-evangelical-christianity/">right wing fundamentalists that now control evangelical Christianity and their theology</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>To blame a lack of reliance on God for this most recent tragedy is a slap in the face of the victims and their families who attended church before or after the shooting&#8230; If Christians want to place blame, blame the culture of violence—not the Prince of Peace</p>

<p>We do not need the government forcing us to say officially-sanctioned prayers in school each day.  Do we think being forced to say a prayer is any prayer at all?  Do we think that in the not-so-distant days of Christendom, when all members of society were considered “Christian” and our nations were “Christian,” that faith was genuine? We have come so far and need to respect the rights of other religious traditions.  We argue for freedom for our missionaries to evangelize in Islamic countries but then we want to remake America in their same restrictive mold.  Sure, today, our faith is sometimes looked down upon, marginalized, and spat on—but the church is in a much better place now that we have regained the pre-Constantinian role of sojourners in a sinful world rather than the inquisitors of godless governments.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many Christian leaders are also pointing out that ultimately the arguments about school prayer and God&#8217;s will are designed to <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/death-violence-and-america-is-god-the-answer-or-the-problem/">take attention away from the discourse about effective regulations to prevent future tragedies</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>When American Christians are more supportive of weapons, war and torture than their unbelieving neighbors, something has gone terribly wrong. When the greatest amount of violence is found precisely in the region of the country where church membership and attendance is the highest we might ask what kind of influence Christians are exerting. Complaints about a lack of official prayer in schools or an absence of religious symbols in the public square don’t get even close to identifying the source of the violence problem.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s common to see specious arguments claiming to know the mind of God being forwarded by hayseeders who don&#8217;t understand the interests co-opting their agenda. These stooges frustratingly lack the ability to ask simple questions like, &#8216;Is this biblical?&#8217; or &#8216;who benefits?&#8217;. Younger Christians that question the political rhetoric of the evangelical churches they find themselves in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-d-mclaren/why-do-evangelicals-disli_b_517094.html">remain quiet about it, fearing ostracization</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many are afraid to admit that they voted for Barack Obama, or believe in evolution, or are concerned about global climate change, or are OK with their friends being gay or priests being married, or use birth control, or wish women could be treated as equals in their church, or don&#8217;t take every word of the Bible as having equal authority and historical accuracy. If they speak up, they will be shunned by their religious authorities &#8211; and zapped by their fellow Christians who have been told to press the punishment button when anyone dares to differ by giving the &#8220;wrong&#8221; answer. So they comply.</p></blockquote>

<p>They comply until the evangelicals pushing an increasingly overt right wing political agenda give them more and more reasons to leave.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Another idiotic message is floating around on Facebook, explaining shootings as God&#8217;s will. I could point out everything wrong with it, but don&#8217;t have the time or patience. Fundamentally it falls for the Manichean mistake of assuming that the world is made up of light and shadow, and that there are no morally gray areas. The simplistic and childish argument basically follows that since everyone who goes to church is a &#8220;good guy&#8221;, that the government doesn&#8217;t need to restrict firearms to reduce homicides and mass murders, but instead needs to &#8220;church&#8221; the &#8220;bad guys&#8221;, because Christianity is a solution to everything, not <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/death-violence-and-america-is-god-the-answer-or-the-problem/">part of the problem</a>.
The Facebook message goes like this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Scott, the father of Rachel Scott, a victim of the Columbine High School shootings in Littleton, Colorado, was invited to address the House Judiciary Committee&#8217;s subcommittee. What he said to our national leaders during this special session of Congress was painfully truthful.
They were not prepared for what he was to say, nor was it received well. It needs to be heard by every parent, every teacher, every politician, every sociologist, every psychologist, and every so-called expert! These courageous words spoken by Darrell Scott are powerful, penetrating, and deeply personal. There is no doubt that God sent this man as a voice crying in the wilderness. The following is a portion of the transcript:</p>

<p>&#8220;Since the dawn of creation there has been both good &amp;evil in the hearts of men and women. We all contain the seeds of kindness or the seeds of violence. The death of my wonderful daughter, Rachel Joy Scott, and the deaths of that heroic teacher, and the other eleven children who died must not be in vain. Their blood cries out for answers.
&#8220;The first recorded act of violence was when Cain slew his brother Abel out in the field. The villain was not the club he used.. Neither was it the NCA, the National Club Association. The true killer was Cain, and the reason for the murder could only be found in Cain&#8217;s heart.</p></blockquote>

<p>It goes without saying that clubs require tedious effort to kill one person, whereas the killers in Columbine and Sandy Hook used semi automatic assault rifles with 30 round magazines and 100 round drums. It also goes without saying that Christians sin all the time, and are meant to throw off the &#8220;rags&#8221; of sin that still &#8220;cling&#8221; to them despite their religious observance. This pointless &#8220;people kill people&#8221; argument overlooks that <a href="http://www.startribune.com/local/182243551.html">4 year olds can kill 2 year olds by mishandling firearms</a>. It overlooks that in China a crazy man stabbing 20 school children killed none of them. Eliminating violence will never be achievable, while restricting access to firearms is substantially easier than pro gun advocates will admit.</p>

<p>This excellent article <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/sandy-hook-and-the-tearing-asunder-of-evangelical-christianity/">destroys most of the rest of this nonsense</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>To blame a lack of reliance on God for this most recent tragedy is a slap in the face of the victims and their families who attended church before or after the shooting&#8230; If Christians want to place blame, blame the culture of violence—not the Prince of Peace</p>

<p>We do not need the government forcing us to say officially-sanctioned prayers in school each day.  Do we think being forced to say a prayer is any prayer at all?  Do we think that in the not-so-distant days of Christendom, when all members of society were considered “Christian” and our nations were “Christian,” that faith was genuine? We have come so far and need to respect the rights of other religious traditions.  We argue for freedom for our missionaries to evangelize in Islamic countries but then we want to remake America in their same restrictive mold.  Sure, today, our faith is sometimes looked down upon, marginalized, and spat on—but the church is in a much better place now that we have regained the pre-Constantinian role of sojourners in a sinful world rather than the inquisitors of godless governments.</p></blockquote>

<p>The rest of the specious bullshit follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;In the days that followed the Columbine tragedy, I was amazed at how quickly fingers began to be pointed at groups such as the NRA. I am not a member of the NRA. I am not a hunter. I do not even own a gun. I am not here to represent or defend the NRA - because I don&#8217;t believe that they are responsible for my daughter&#8217;s death. Therefore I do not believe that they need to be defended. If I believed they had anything to do with Rachel&#8217;s murder I would be their strongest opponent
I am here today to declare that Columbine was not just a tragedy &#8211; it was a spiritual event that should be forcing us to look at where the real blame lies! Much of the blame lies here in this room. Much of the blame lies behind the pointing fingers of the accusers themselves. I wrote a poem just four nights ago that expresses my feelings best.</p>

<p>Your laws ignore our deepest needs,
Your words are empty air.
You&#8217;ve stripped away our heritage,
You&#8217;ve outlawed simple prayer.
Now gunshots fill our classrooms,
And precious children die.
You seek for answers everywhere,
And ask the question &#8220;Why?&#8221;
You regulate restrictive laws,
Through legislative creed.
And yet you fail to understand,
That God is what we need!</p>

<p>&#8220;Men and women are three-part beings. We all consist of body, mind, and spirit. When we refuse to acknowledge a third part of our make-up, we create a void that allows evil, prejudice, and hatred to rush in and wreak havoc. Spiritual presences were present within our educational systems for most of our nation&#8217;s history. Many of our major colleges began as theological seminaries. This is a historical fact.
What has happened to us as a nation? We have refused to honor God, and in so doing, we open the doors to hatred and violence. And when something as terrible as Columbine&#8217;s tragedy occurs &#8211; politicians immediately look for a scapegoat such as the NRA. They immediately seek to pass more restrictive laws that contribute to erode away our personal and private liberties. We do not need more restrictive laws.
Eric and Dylan would not have been stopped by metal detectors. No amount of gun laws can stop someone who spends months planning this type of massacre. The real villain lies within our own hearts.</p>

<p>&#8220;As my son Craig lay under that table in the school library and saw his two friends murdered before his very eyes, he did not hesitate to pray in school. I defy any law or politician to deny him that right! I challenge every young person in America , and around the world, to realize that on April 20, 1999, at Columbine High School prayer was brought back to our schools. Do not let the many prayers offered by those students be in vain. Dare to move into the new millennium with a sacred disregard for legislation that violates your God-given right to communicate with Him.</p>

<p>To those of you who would point your finger at the NRA &#8211; I give to you a sincere challenge.. Dare to examine your own heart before casting the first stone!
My daughter&#8217;s death will not be in vain! The young people of this country will not allow that to happen!&#8221;
- Darrell Scott</p>

<p>Do what the media did not - - let the nation hear this man&#8217;s speech. Please share this with your FB friends!</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This bullshit has been going around on Facebook:</p>

<blockquote><p>Very insightful and very true&#8230;.Take a second to read this:</p>

<p>Apparently the White House referred to Christmas Trees as “Holiday Trees” for the first time this year which prompted CBS presenter, Ben Stein, to present this piece which I would like to share with you. I think it applies just as much to many countries as it does to America &#8230;</p>

<p>The following was written by Ben Stein and recited by him on CBS Sunday Morning Commentary.</p>

<p>My confession:</p>

<p>I am a Jew, and every single one of my ancestors was Jewish. And it does not bother me even a little bit when people call those beautiful lit up, bejewelled trees, Christmas trees. I don&#8217;t feel threatened. I don&#8217;t feel discriminated against. That&#8217;s what they are, Christmas trees.</p></blockquote>

<p>Stein loves to wear Judaism on his shoulder, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stein#Dominique_Strauss-Kahn">likening Obama and all proponents of science education as Nazis</a>. Talking about his &#8220;intelligent design&#8221; propaganda movie Stien said &#8220;Love of God and compassion and empathy leads you to a very glorious place, and science leads you to killing people.&#8221; The Anti-Defamation League issued a statement condemning the film&#8217;s misuse of the Holocaust and its imagery, &#8220;Using the Holocaust in order to tarnish those who promote the theory of evolution is outrageous and trivializes the complex factors that led to the mass extermination of European Jewry&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote><p>It doesn&#8217;t bother me a bit when people say, “Merry Christmas” to me. I don&#8217;t think they are slighting me or getting ready to put me in a ghetto. In fact, I kind of like it. It shows that we are all brothers and sisters celebrating this happy time of year. It doesn&#8217;t bother me at all that there is a manger scene on display at a key intersection near my beach house in Malibu. If people want a crib, it&#8217;s just as fine with me as is the Menorah a few hundred yards away.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whether he personally likes Christian imagery in public has no bearing on whether it is constitutional to use government money or government property to put up religious displays.</p>

<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t like getting pushed around for being a Jew, and I don&#8217;t think Christians like getting pushed around for being Christians. I think people who believe in God are sick and tired of getting pushed around, period. I have no idea where the concept came from, that America is an explicitly atheist country. I can&#8217;t find it in the Constitution and I don&#8217;t like it being shoved down my throat.</p></blockquote>

<p>Stein misrepresents the first amendment, which clearly states &#8220;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion&#8221;. This means that public money and public property cannot be used to establish a church, and cannot be used to promote any one religion. That&#8217;s why there are no prayers in US public schools, and no ten commandments in US courthouses.</p>

<blockquote><p>Or maybe I can put it another way: where did the idea come from that we should worship celebrities and we aren&#8217;t allowed to worship God? I guess that&#8217;s a sign that I&#8217;m getting old, too. But there are a lot of us who are wondering where these celebrities came from and where the America we knew went to.</p></blockquote>

<p>Separation of church and state doesn&#8217;t prevent any individual from practicing their religion or worshipping any God. It just means that the government isn&#8217;t allowed to insist to Hindu students that they must worship and Abrahamic God (&#8220;You shall have no other Gods except me&#8221;). The idea that the &#8220;America we knew&#8221; was a better place is a classic argument of conservatives, and is simply false, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect">the highest IQ on average ever</a>, and the <a href="http://edge.org/conversation/mc2011-history-violence-pinker">lowest rates of crime and violence ever</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>In light of the many jokes we send to one another for a laugh, this is a little different: This is not intended to be a joke; it&#8217;s not funny, it&#8217;s intended to get you thinking.</p>

<p>Billy Graham&#8217;s daughter was interviewed on the Early Show and Jane Clayson asked her: “How could God let something like this happen?” (regarding Hurricane Katrina). Anne Graham gave an extremely profound and insightful response. She said: “I believe God is deeply saddened by this, just as we are, but for years we&#8217;ve been telling God to get out of our schools, to get out of our government and to get out of our lives. And being the gentleman He is, I believe He has calmly backed out. How can we expect God to give us His blessing and His protection if we demand He leave us alone?”</p></blockquote>

<p>Jesus makes it clear that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Siloam">tragedy and calamity is not divine retribution</a>. Lotz said exactly the <a href="http://www.prayerfoundation.org/billy_grahams_daughter.htm">same unbiblical shit after 9/11</a>. Bryan Fisher said the same thing after the Conneticuit shooting:</p>

</a>
<div class="video-info" >http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/fischer-god-didnt-stop-ct-school-shooting-because-hes-gentleman-who-doesnt-go-where-he-not-w

Bryan Fischer explains that the massacre at a Connecticut elementary school could have been stopped by God, but he has been kicked out of public schools and doesn&#8217;t go where he is not wanted.</div>
</div>


<blockquote><p>In light of recent events&#8230; terrorists attack, school shootings, etc. I think it started when Madeleine Murray O&#8217;Hare (she was murdered, her body found a few years ago) complained she didn&#8217;t want prayer in our schools, and we said OK. Then someone said you better not read the Bible in school. The Bible says thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, and love your neighbour as yourself. And we said OK.</p></blockquote>

<p>The American government did not say &#8220;OK&#8221; to one woman&#8217;s demands. They followed the US constitution, and removed any material in <em>public</em> schools that would represent an establishment of religion, which forces students to comply with a set religion. Students are allowed to pray in student-initiated prayers, but cannot be directed or compelled to pray by teachers. Teachers are allowed to read from the bible and discuss it as literature in lessons such as history.</p>

<p>One of the key features of a secular system of law and order is that nobody is above the law, it applies equally to all people. That means that a crime committed against someone you don&#8217;t like is a crime, and still deserves justice. When someone you don&#8217;t like is arrested, they still have the right to a fair trial and a legal defence. Murder is murder and will be punished by secular law whether the ten commandments are in schools or courthouses, or not, or the accused or the victim is a religious believer or not. To suggest otherwise suggests delighting in tragedy of people you hate, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_the_other_cheek">you might just remember Jesus preaching against</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Then Dr. Benjamin Spock said we shouldn&#8217;t spank our children when they misbehave, because their little personalities would be warped and we might damage their self-esteem (Dr. Spock&#8217;s son committed suicide). We said an expert should know what he&#8217;s talking about. And we said okay.</p></blockquote>

<p>Pulling out anecdotes of suffering reeks of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude">Schadenfreude</a>, and says nothing about whether the self-esteem movement is useful or not.</p>

<blockquote><p>Now we&#8217;re asking ourselves why our children have no conscience, why they don&#8217;t know right from wrong, and why it doesn&#8217;t bother them to kill strangers, their classmates, and themselves.</p>

<p>Probably, if we think about it long and hard enough, we can figure it out. I think it has a great deal to do with &#8216;WE REAP WHAT WE SOW.&#8217;</p>

<p>Funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world&#8217;s going to hell. Funny how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what the Bible says. Funny how you can send &#8216;jokes&#8217; through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice about sharing. Funny how lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene articles pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion of God is suppressed in the school and workplace.</p></blockquote>

<p>Because unlike what the religious right thinks, &#8220;freedom of religion&#8221; does not mean &#8221;<a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/does-randy-forbes-understand-how-first-amendment-works">nobody is allowed to criticise me</a>&#8221;. Most people who post this kind of content will go through life thinking that most people hate them for their religion. But when Christians go arond with a self-righteous phariseeism trying to criticise, blame and haras anyone who doesn&#8217;t agree with them (including people from their own faith), the real reason they&#8217;re hated is because they&#8217;re a douchebag.</p>

<time datetime="2012-12-07T20:17:00+11:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Dec 7<span>th</span>, 2012</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/in-spite-of-the-scandals-religious-groups-still-lead-the-way-on-public-good-20121206-2ay69.html">Andrew West published an opinion piece suggesting the church should still be considered a public good despite widely publicised scandals</a>. Trying to find sources for the 2011 NCLS data, however, turns up only statements from Dr Ruth Powell, the director of the National Church Life Survey from her <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/religionandethicsreport/australia27s-national-church-life-survey/4397166">interview with West on Radio National</a>. Looking at the transcript, a few key points come up.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ruth Powell: What we see from the results are that even though the church may be smaller than it was in previous decades, in a sense it’s consolidating. It is stronger. The signs of health are greater than they were a decade ago. We don’t have any results on numerical growth or decline at this stage. There are signs overseas that perhaps plateau has taken place. We don’t have the data in Australia yet.</p></blockquote>

<p>8 days earlier, the <a href="http://www.theherald.com.au/story/1131735/opinion-churches-future-depends-on-their-followers/">Herald Sun published Powell&#8217;s opinion piece</a> specifying that the proportion of believers going to church once a month is &#8220;around 15%&#8221;, whereas <a href="http://www.ncls.org.au/default.aspx?docid=2278">NCLS data</a> from 1998 found that 20% of the population claimed to attend religious services at least monthly or more often and in 2002 this figure had dropped to 18.6% of the population. The continuation of the decline from 2002 should also suggest that when the figure is released, it is likely that weekly attendence will have also dropped below the <a href="http://www.ncls.org.au/default.aspx?docid=2250">7.5% of Australians in 2001</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ruth Powell: Six out of ten people who are in church are women. Now that’s not a new trend. Women are generally more religious than men. That’s something that sociologists have found in pretty well every country and every religion&#8230; And there are some signs that working women are less likely to go to church than men&#8230;</p>

<p>Church is a space that is often very relational. And women tend to be strong in terms of building and nurturing relationships with others. And I think that the space for exploring those issues…church communities, faith communities, facilitate that sort of relationship&#8230;</p>

<p>We have many studies happening in terms of attitudes to women. But there are those who are embracing the role of women in leadership and those who have a different perspective. But what we see is, women are the bedrock of a lot of churches. They are the ones who are filling voluntary roles, not only in the churches but also in terms of the wider communities.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many Christians have opinions on the cause of the observed gender gap. Christian Piatt suggests that it is normal and natural for <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/why-women-are-the-key-to-the-churchs-future/">women to be caregivers and therefore are better at establishing community</a>. But this glosses over the real issues, and the major implications in church life. With over 60% of the church being women, a third less men are there. 25% of married Christian women <a href="http://churchformen.com/men-and-church/info-for-pastors/">go to churches their husbands refuse to attend</a>.</p>

<p>This leaves roughly 8% are single women who don&#8217;t have single men in their church to consider dating, a position that can be emotionally draining.
David Murrow, author of Why Men Hate Church tells the story of Caroline, &#8220;a twenty-nine-year-old single woman who won’t date non-Christian men. “But I’m beginning to rethink that&#8230; There are no single guys my age.&#8221; Many other Christian singles have given up on the idea that they could meet a Christian man at church, worried that they <a href="http://oursinglepurpose.com/2012/10/10/be-still/">&#8220;would miss out on “the man” if [they] chose the wrong gym&#8221;</a>. Responding to a blog post on singleness, churchgoing Sydney Anglican women spoke of dejection at being <a href="http://sydneyanglicans.net/life/daytoday/single_christian_female_30">isolated and ignored for their singleness</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>I often feel like the freak no one wants to talk to at church…”</p>

<p>“[singles] feel invisible or unwanted because they are in the minority.”</p>

<p>“I don&#8217;t want to be left standing all by myself after church or have people walk away from me when I try and start a conversation with them.”</p>

<p>“It is so painfully lonely not fitting in and feeling socially worthless, particularly when you hear about all the social gatherings that go on, none of which you ever receive an invitation to. It is awful.”</p>

<p>“It is really hard to continue going to church when every week you know you will be left out after the meeting. It is painful watching friends greet each other and give out invites and be all happy and together.”</p>

<p>“I am looking for a little bit of love from my Christian community, but instead I feel like a leper… I never get invited anywhere.”</p>

<p>“People think that you must be busy Friday and Saturday nights, and the reality is, that you’re sitting at home in front of the TV…”</p>

<p>“I have not met any single person in their 30s who is not really hurting… Get to your mid 30s, when all your friends are married, the reality is that while your married friends&#8217; social network is rapidly expanding, the single persons&#8217; network is rapidly diminishing.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Murrow suggests that the church drives &#8216;manly&#8217; men away with its feminised culture. He writes <a href="http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/ChurchAndMinistry/menhatingchurch.aspx">&#8220;Today’s churchgoing man is humble, tidy, dutiful, and above all, nice&#8221;</a>, suggesting that men excusing themselves saying that church is boring and irrelevant could be more concerned at the lack of masculinity. Murrow&#8217;s critique is mostly directed at stylistic issues, suggesting that &#8220;The feminine atmosphere in our churches causes women to feel loved and nurtured, but men to feel hesitant and restrained&#8221; and pushing for changes to preaching styles and worship teams.</p>

<p>Dr Rod Rosenbladt goes further than stylistic issues, suggesting that <a href="http://www.newreformationpress.com/blog/nrp-freebies/the-gospel-for-those-broken-by-the-church/">it is the ministers who closely identify with the maternal symbolism of church</a>, making the many men (and women) already angry with what the church has done reject it outright:</p>

<blockquote><p>There is a predictable psychological profile of the clergy, including our closer
relationship with our mothers, but not with our fathers. For most of us pastors, the link
between Jesus and the church (a mother symbol) is so tight, so identical, that to be
angry with mother church is the same as rejecting Jesus! It is not.</p></blockquote>

<p>Paul Coughlin paints a starker picture of churches <a href="http://www.crosswalk.com/blogs/paul-coughlin/pain-and-prejudice-11535858.html">actively driving away men by demonising them as spiritual losers and sexual predators</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Here are some of the messages Christian men have been told, some for decades:</p>

<ul>
<li>If there is a major problem in a couple’s marriage, whether or not it leads to divorce, it is ultimately the husband’s fault.</li>
<li>Women are more moral and spiritual than men.</li>
<li>Women are more sensitive to the Holy Spirit than men.</li>
</ul>


<p>Christian men don’t like the prejudice against them, they complain&#8211;sometimes bitterly&#8211;in private, but they keep going, though something happens to many of them beginning in their late thirties. Church becomes a chore. And a bore. They go out of duty, not because they receive much inspiration there as men, or truly helpful instruction regarding marriage and gender differences. They go because they feel they have to.</p>

<p>If you question this prejudice against men, then ask yourself: Why do men have “Accountability Groups,” at church, yet women have “Fellowship Groups”? Men are treated as if they are one step away from committing felonies. So they require constant monitoring, constant “accountability,” as if they are at risk of jumping a form of spiritual bail.</p>

<p>Bigotry robs people of dignity and value. It frustrates common and healthy human desires, creates dark psychic storm clouds, and unless a man is unusually robust, creates spiritual fissures. Bitterness, anger, and resentment seep into men’s souls</p></blockquote>

<p>Powell goes on to explain the aeging demographic, correllated with an oversupply of women in dying churches.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ruth Powell: The average age of a church attender is 55-years-old. And that is ageing. So those big mainstream denominations have more older people and partly it’s history catching up with them. In the ’60s and ’70s, the baby-boomers—those born after World War II—as we say: they voted with their feet. And they said, church is not engaging me, the institutional church is not making a connection—they left. And the church said, that’s all right, they’ll be back, they’ll have kids and they’ll come back, because that’s what’s always happened in the past—and it had. Your stage of life was the thing that affected. The problem is, that generation didn’t come back, the following generation were less there and then now, the children are less there.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many Chrisitans believe that the Millenial generation will come back into the church if young adults leave during their younger years. But discussion from Barna suggests that this may not be the case, with <a href="http://www.barna.org/teens-next-gen-articles/534-five-myths-about-young-adult-church-dropouts">the Millenial generation delaying committment, marriage and children</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Millennials are getting married roughly six years later than did the Boomers; they are having their first child much later in life; and they are eight times more likely than were the youth of the 1960s to come from homes where their own biological parents were never married&#8230;  If this generation is having children later in life, are church leaders simply content to wait longer? And if Mosaics return, will they do so with extra burdens—emotional, financial, spiritual, and relational—from their years apart from Christian community? More to the point, what if Mosaics turn out to be a generation in which most do not return?</p></blockquote>

<p>Other trends indicate that more children are born out of wedlock. If couples with chrilden are key to the future of the church, will churches be ready to accept those who have had their kids before marriage, if they married at all? Dr Arnie Cole suggests that the church has a bad history in this regard, with many <a href="http://www.gotandemblog.com/mean-christians">mean, bitter Christians proclaiming their self-righteousness and believing it is evangelism</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>when I was a non-believer living with Char before we were married, a Christian brother would come up to me and say bluntly that all fornicators go to hell. This poor guy tried to do all the work of the Holy Spirit for me, the spiritual loser. This mean-spirited approach simply left out the heart of Jesus or the love He has for the lost person.</p>

<p>The funny thing is, Satan tricked him into thinking he had proclaimed God’s Word when, actually, I was so offended that I’d become more resistant than I was before God was “proclaimed” to me.</p></blockquote>

<p>This form of moralising is a far cry from preaching that Jesus wants the rose.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ruth Powell: we can see the ageing starting with the Pentecostals but they are still much younger even than the general Australian population and that’s an interesting story for all the churches to listen to and say, what is attractive to some young people, Australian people, that those Pentecostal churches are offering&#8230;</p>

<p>Whether that’s the music…but it’s things such as language, dress, informality et cetera, that means there are fewer cultural barriers for a society, say, that has become more informal. Now, I still think that there are a lot of young people who have disengaged from not only church, but from religion and spirituality generally. And that’s what we hear from the wider community. And so even though some churches are doing well at connecting, I think the message remains that there are a lot of young people for whom the churches have not yet found a way of communicating their message in an engaging or relevant way.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many have written on the challenge of creating a community that is <a href="rachelheldevans.com/sunday-morning">culturally relevant while also theologically open to questions on non core issues</a>. Rachel Held Evans writes that she is &#8220;tired of being seen as a project and a prayer request because I believe the earth is more than 6,000 years old and that Anne Frank didn’t go to hell&#8221;. In fact, Brian McLaren suggests that conservative churches with a young demographic <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-d-mclaren/why-do-evangelicals-disli_b_517094.html">attract many theological liberals who keep quiet about their beliefs</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many are afraid to admit that they voted for Barack Obama, or believe in evolution, or are concerned about global climate change, or are OK with their friends being gay or priests being married, or use birth control, or wish women could be treated as equals in their church, or don&#8217;t take every word of the Bible as having equal authority and historical accuracy. If they speak up, they will be shunned by their religious authorities &#8211; and zapped by their fellow Christians who have been told to press the punishment button when anyone dares to differ by giving the &#8220;wrong&#8221; answer. So they comply.</p></blockquote>

<p>West goes on to quiz Powell about why people go to church.</p>

<blockquote><p>Andrew West: [Church atendees] go because they believe in God. But for some people it’s actually a lot more complex.</p>

<p>Ruth Powell: No, in fact we know from our…people who are new to church life, that beliefs come later. You start with belonging. You start with relationship. You start going to church because a friend says, hey, this is a place that’s helped me in my life; it’s helped, it’s…you know, they fed me when my…when we were going hungry, they’ve helped my kids, they were there when life was tough for me. You should come and check this place out. It’s a good community to be part of. Newcomers come because someone invited them.</p>

<p>Now when we look at just the broader spread of church attenders, why do they go? It is faith…it’s reasons of practices of faith. They’re going to explore faith, to grow in their faith, to find out about faith. And so you look…that’s what they value; they value those aspects that are the faith practices. They also value belonging. And what they…when we ask them, what do you think this church should be working on in the next 12 months—because in a sense this is a strategic planning tool for churches—and we say, all right, what can you improve on? The top thing is, we want…make this place a place where people feel they belong. Grow our sense of community and belonging because again, it’s the Putnam bonding social capital, you know. It’s in that social glue that I can grow in my faith. This is not a solo thing. I do it better with other people.</p></blockquote>

<p>Evangelicals have always believed that the bible can be shown to be evidentially true, and that faith following from the facts is enough to create feelings among believers.</p>

<p>From the section &#8221;<a href="http://www.campuscrusade.com/Now-That-You-Have-Received-Christ.html">Now That You Have Received Christ</a>&#8221; from the Campus Crusade for Christ&#8217;s 1958 Four Spiritual Laws booklet</p>

<blockquote><p>Do Not Depend on Feelings</p>

<p>The promise of God&#8217;s Word, the Bible - not our feelings - is our authority. The Christian lives by faith (trust) in the trustworthiness of God Himself and His Word. This train diagram illustrates the relationship among fact (God and His Word), faith (our trust in God and His Word), and feeling (the result of our faith and obedience) (John 14:21).</p>

<p><img src="/images/caboose.gif" title="Caboose of Feelings pulled by Faith" alt="Caboose of Feelings pulled by Faith" /></p>

<p>The train will run with or without a caboose. However, it would be useless to attempt to pull the train by the caboose. In the same way, as Christians we do not depend on feelings or emotions, but we place our faith (trust) in the trustworthiness of God and the promises of His Word.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s interesting to find a Catholic admitting that, for some believers, it seems to be that the train of belief is driven by the caboose, with belief in God and adoption of Christian teaching and morals following a feeling of acceptance and belonging in the community.</p>

<blockquote><p>Andrew West: How many people find it easy to ask others to come to church?</p>

<p>Ruth Powell: Well I think this is the key story for the churches. I think churches…if we sling back in history, you had the village church and mostly Anglican, you know: Church of England. Every village had their church and everybody in the village belonged to the village church. And that was brought out to Australia and you had the parish church and if you were in that parish, and this is how still the Catholics think, if you’re in the parish and you’re Catholic, well you belong to our parish.</p>

<p>Now that’s all breaking down now. And the place of church in Australian society, as in many western societies, is being renegotiated. And I think the church is probably a little bit in the wilderness at the moment and it’s going to take decades—it is taking decades—to find their role and their place. And partly, the churches are needing to discover what it is to be in mission, to be a sent people again, and to actually work out how to speak of the message that they believe they have, to a society that is saying, you are not relevant, you are not useful, I do not trust you. And so inviting becomes to relationship and you need to invite. And churches…people who go to church, if church is to survive, people will need to have to work out how to share in an authentic way what it is that their faith community offers them and why they would encourage others authentically to experience that same…</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Logo is a classic lisp like turtle graphics language and was my introduction to programming. With Logo, you can teach some advanced concepts like fractal patterns, and there&#8217;s some great online examples that demonstrate a few simple, elegant algorithms to generate pretty pictures.</p>

<p>Papert is a really nice online Logo interpreter using JavaScript and Canvas, look at these examples:</p>
