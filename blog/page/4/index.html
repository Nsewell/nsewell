  <div class="entry-content"><p>Danny Nalliah, a false prophet running the apostate church &#8220;Catch the Fire Ministries&#8221; has launched his own political party, &#8220;rise up Australia&#8221;. Nalliah&#8217;s church has been <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/costello-slams-cults-retribution-claims/story-e6frg6of-1111118814587">denounced as a cult by Peter Costello, someone his false prophesy lead him to &#8216;anoint&#8217; as Australia&#8217;s future Prime Minister</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>A FURIOUS Peter Costello has rounded on a Christian cult for suggesting the Victorian bushfires were divine retribution for the state&#8217;s abortion laws, describing it as &#8220;beyond the bounds of decency&#8221;.</p>

<p>Just three weeks ago, the former federal treasurer sent a video message to a special Australia Day prayer meeting organised by Catch the Fire Ministries leader Danny Nalliah.</p>

<p>But he reacted angrily to a statement by Mr Nalliah yesterday recalling a dream concerning the consequences of Victorian abortion legislation that became law last year.</p>

<p>The preacher claimed God&#8217;s &#8220;conditional protection&#8221; had been &#8220;removed from the nation of Australia, particular Victoria, for approving the slaughter of innocent children in the womb&#8221;.</p>

<p>&#8220;To link the death and the suffering of bushfire victims to other political events is appalling, heartless and wrong,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those who have suffered deserve every support and sympathy. It is beyond the bounds of decency to try to make moral or political points out of such a tragedy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Nalliah&#8217;s full prophesy <a href="https://signposts02.wordpress.com/2009/02/14/nalliah-prophecy-claims-fall-short/">said this</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“I saw a man firing randomly with a weapon at people on the streets and many were falling dead. I was very disturbed and was crying. Then the scene changed and I saw fire everywhere with flames burning very high and uncontrollably. With this I awoke from my dream with the interpretation as the following words came to me in a flash from the Spirit of God,  ‘My wrath is about to be released upon Australia, in particular Victoria, for approving the slaughter of the innocent children in the womb.  Now, call on My people to repent and pray!’”</p></blockquote>

<p>This is false prophesy; there have been no major mass murders since 1996. If the Victorian bushfires really were God&#8217;s judgement for abortion legislation, then where is the gunman? In reality, <a href="/blog/2013/01/20/rick-perry/">Australian gun control works much better than school prayer</a>.</p>

<p>Nalliah also incorrectly predicted that <a href="http://www.christian-witness.org/blog/2007/11/26/catch-the-fire%E2%80%93sequel/">Howard would win in the 2007 election before stepping aside for Costello to become Prime Minister</a>. He <a href="http://www.crikey.com.au/2007/08/14/costello-gods-own-prime-minister/">likens himself to the prophet Samuel anointing David</a> &#8220;The Lord spoke clearly to me about how Prophet Samuel in the Word of God was sent to anoint David as the future King of Israel&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>I thank the Lord that I just had a one to one meeting with Peter Costello [and Howard]&#8230; The Lord had given me a clear prophetic Word for both of them and I thank Him I was able to deliver His Word in addition to praying with both of these Federal Government Leaders&#8230;</p>

<p>I will boldly declare that Prime Minister John Howard will be re-elected in the November election (if the Body of Christ unites in prayer and action) and pass the leadership onto Peter Costello sometime after.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nalliah waters down his prophesy by hedging his bets on whether Christians pray the right way, creating an &#8220;out&#8221; for his faulty prophesy. As Rev Dr Gordon Moyes notes, &#8220;True prophets never give a “conditional” word of prophecy.&#8221; Moyes goes on to note that</p>

<blockquote><p>The majority of patients coming to the psychiatrists I have been responsible for employing in Wesley Mission’s Mental Health Hospitals claim God speaks to them. In other Christian circles and in Christian books, I note some people seek to get their own way by using God speaking to them as almost a way of stopping any questioning of their ideas.</p></blockquote>

<p>The American televangelist Kenneth Copeland confirmed Nalliah’s prophetic anointing of John Howard as Prime Minister, declaring that <a href="http://jmm.aaa.net.au/articles/20588.htm">Howard was “God’s man in Australia”</a>.</p>

<p>The Australian recounts the &#8220;preparation&#8221; (anointing as God&#8217;s elect) that happened with Costello:</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr Nalliah met Mr Costello ahead of the 2007 election to &#8220;prepare&#8221; him for the prime ministership. A church member publicly recounted an episode where &#8220;the spirit of God suddenly moved me to cry out in the loud Aboriginal-like tongue followed by the shouting out several times of &#8216;the honourable Peter Costello, prime minister-elect of Australia&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>And just ahead of an Australia Day prayer meeting, Mr Nalliah announced: &#8220;Our silent prayer is that Peter &#8230; will be here to take the leadership of the party and lead the nation into victory as prime minister.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Nalliah <a href="http://www.christian-witness.org/blog/2007/07/13/pentecostal-disgrace-catch-the-fire-honouring-the-late-frank-houston/">honoured the self-consessed child molester Frank Houston as the greatest influence on his ministry</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The apostle Paul said that when he came to the church at Corinth it wasn’t with wise and persuasive words but it was with a demonstration of the Holy Spirit’s power&#8230; And that’s exactly how I knew Pastor Frank Houston. He was a man who moved in the power of the Holy Ghost. His heart was for real salvations, real healings, and real deliverances. I was fortunate enough to be a guest in his house on numerous occasions.. He was an inspiration not just to me but to many other spiritual sons and daughters throughout this nation.</p>

<p>I love Papa Frank with all my heart. I wish I could give him a big hug.</p></blockquote>

<p>Pastor Bob Cotton goes on to elaborate about his and Nalliah&#8217;s imitation of Houston&#8217;s techniques:</p>

<blockquote><p>I would ring him up sometimes and I’d say, ‘Pastor Frank. This devil - I couldn’t shift it the other day. What do you reckon?’ And he’d start to tell me a few little insights and different things that he’d known in the past, and we’ve seen many people come into freedom&#8230; It’s my honour to stand here today and say Pastor Frank wasn’t just a father in the faith to me, he was one of my closest mates and I love him. I cherish his memory and, like Danny, I wish he were here so I could give him a great big hug tonight because there was nobody quite like [him]</p></blockquote>

<p>Houston was expelled from his denomination for the destructive effect that his sexual abuse had on the church <a href="http://www.christian-witness.org/blog/2007/11/26/cetf-catch-the-fire-a-letter-to-the-editor/">and on victims</a>. By Nalliah&#8217;s own confession, he did not preach with logic and reason, but with signs and wonders. Given Houston&#8217;s history of sexually abusing multiple boys he was clearly not inspired or empowered by the Holy Spirit, and his signs and wonders were faked. Nalliah has learned to perform all of his spurious miracles from his spiritual father, refining the techniques and making even more aggrandised claims of raising three people from the dead.</p>

<p>Now Nalliah is running for office, hoping for a resurgence of Tea Party hysteria to propel an anti-Islamic, climate change denialist agenda into parliament.  Nalliah previously tried to <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/federal-election/gillard-bid-to-win-back-christians-20100805-11krh.html#ixzz2KepvdQfT">smear the Prime Minister for her atheism</a>. This sounds like the hysteria of Tea Party style dominionist rhetoric, claiming that the country was started on Christian values, and the only way to hold up democracy is to have Christian leaders occupying every leadership position.</p>

<blockquote><p>Danny Nalliah&#8230; released a statement giving five reasons not to vote Labor: it would be a vote for the Greens, Prime Minister Julia Gillard is in a de facto relationship, she is childless, she is an atheist, and she refused to take an oath on the Bible.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nalliah&#8217;s politics <a href="http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/new-political-party-rise-up-australia-wants-muslim-intake-cuts/story-fndo1gb8-1226575716789">have attracted discussion</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Pastor Daniel”, of Catch the Fire Ministries, says a conversation with Jesus that went from 3.40am to 6am one morning prompted his move to Australia.</p>

<p>Since arriving here he has claimed that Victoria’s abortion laws caused the Black Saturday bushfires and that his prayers have brought dead people back to life.</p>

<p>He declared Prime Minister Julia Gillard a heathen “living in sin” and former Greens leader Bob Brown an “openly practising homosexual” and said that he felt sick to the stomach watching them shake hands.</p>

<p>Rise Up Australia will push for cuts to Australia’s “Muslim intake”, for an end to multiculturalism and for protection of Australia’s Judaeo-Christian heritage&#8230;</p>

<p>Climate change skeptic Christopher Monckton spoke at the launch, giving a very graphic description of abortions and leading a round of patriotic cheers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Using abortion as a highly emotional topic as a <a href="http://localhost:4321/blog/2013/01/03/rentier-theology/">smokescreen for an agenda that is factually and morally bankrupt is a common tactic for extreme right wing politics</a>. Nalliah claims to be protecting Australia&#8217;s &#8220;Judeo Christian&#8221; heritage, a classic racist dog whistle. The RUA claim they want &#8220;To promote harmony, freedom and tolerance among Australians; specifically we oppose multiculturalism&#8221;. Great. Nalliah in 2004 called for Christians to <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2004/s1217824.htm">&#8220;pull down Satan&#8217;s strongholds&#8221;, including brothels and gambling places, mosques and temples</a>.</p>

<p>By claiming Christianity as the inspiration for their extremist politics, Nalliah and Monkton may pick up a small number of votes, but will continue the perception that Chrisitanity is strongly tied to a right wing agenda. If Christians themselves don&#8217;t speak out against this, it will give significant credance to those who want to wipe all religion from public life in Australia.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/bible-gun.jpg" alt="Bible used to justify weapons today" /></p>

<p>Throughout history, the bible has been used as justification for various wars. Dr. Eric Seibert suggests that modern readers <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/2013/02/when-the-good-book-is-bad-challenging-the-bibles-violent-portrayals-of-god/">should be mindful of the consequences of</a> a literal interpretation of problematic Old Testament passages:</p>

<blockquote><p>What happens when reading the Bible pushes people away from God rather than leads them closer to God?</p>

<p>If we feel compelled to accept what we read at face value, and are forbidden from asking honest questions about the troublesome texts we encounter, we run the risk of using the Bible in ways that may harm others</p></blockquote>

<p>In many Old Testament passages, Seibert writes, &#8220;lethal violence is condoned and sometimes even celebrated.  Passages like these create significant problems for Christian readers.&#8221; He <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/2013/02/when-the-bible-sanctions-violence-must-we/">continues</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>It is extremely dangerous to endorse violent texts like these. Tragically, this kind of approval has often led to future acts of violence against others&#8230;</p>

<p>As Christians, we have a moral obligation to critique the assumption that violence is somehow “virtuous,” in spite of what the Bible suggests on numerous occasions.</p>

<p>Violence is not a virtue. It is not a fruit of the spirit or a mark of discipleship&#8230; There are no moral grounds for slaughtering babies, infants, or toddlers. Yet the Bible justifies their extermination on more than one occasion.</p>

<p>Surely, those of us who follow the prince of Peace, the God of Life, must raise our voices in protest and object. We must say, “This is not right!” Such violence is never justifiable and should never be condoned.</p></blockquote>

<p>Seibert <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/2013/02/learning-to-read-the-bible-nonviolently/">suggests that readers engage with violence by trying to empathise with the victims</a>. This would be in line with Jesus&#8217;s teaching on the golden rule.</p>

<p>The question he&#8217;s getting at is whether violence in the Old Testament demonstrates inspiration if it must be resolved with an apparent contradiction with the incarnation of Logos. Working though these issues and understanding the history and interpreting the OT though an NT lens, without interposing modern secular moral standards.</p>

<blockquote><p>Reading this way sensitizes us to the problem of violence in these texts and keeps us from simplistically classifying such moral atrocities as good.</p>

<p>The conquest narrative in Joshua 6-11 reminds us that religious violence is extremely dangerous because it gives divine sanction to behaviors that in any other context would be deemed immoral. Moreover, if one assumes the narrative was intended to bolster the political ambitions of King Josiah, it stands as a sober reminder of the way political leaders sometimes use religion to promote their own agendas.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>There is a funny thing about history. Even though there are countless books waiting to be investigated and read, myriad articles from the times, and an abundance of other evidence, we human beings would <a href="https://mabworld.wordpress.com/2012/02/27/the-fundamentalist-history-they-dont-want-you-to-know/">rather have someone else — one of our contemporaries — tell us what it is</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>As George Orwell opined in <em>Ninteen Eighty Four</em>, &#8220;whoever controls the present controls the past&#8221;.
Even though the US senate in 1797 that &#8221;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tripoli">the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion</a>,&#8221; it&#8217;s become common to hear right wing Christians insist the opposite:</p>

<div class="figure"><a href="http://theamericanjesus.net/?p=3881"><img src="/images/jesus-constitution.jpg" link="http://theamericanjesus.net/?p=3881" title="Jesus giving the US constitution to the founding fathers by Jon McNaughton" ><p>Jesus giving the US constitution to the founding fathers by Jon McNaughton</span></a></div>


<p>Demographic changes in the United States mean that white evangelical Christians are a smaller and smaller voting bloc. As the Religious Right attempting to broaden their base to black and latino Christians, they emphasise anti-abortion and anti-gay positions, and try to downplay their history of segregationalist and White Supremacist links. They also try to claim that they have always been against legal access to abortions, despite <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5502785">evidence to the contrary</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Although various Roman Catholic groups denounced the ruling, and Christianity Today complained that the Roe decision “runs counter to the moral teachings of Christianity through the ages but also to the moral sense of the American people,” the vast majority of evangelical leaders said virtually nothing about it; many of those who did comment actually applauded the decision. W. Barry Garrett of Baptist Press wrote, “Religious liberty, human equality and justice are advanced by the Supreme Court abortion decision.” Indeed, even before the Roe decision, the messengers (delegates) to the 1971 Southern Baptist Convention gathering in St. Louis, Missouri, adopted a resolution that stated, “we call upon Southern Baptists to work for legislation that will allow the possibility of abortion under such conditions as rape, incest, clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother.” W.A. Criswell, former president of the Southern Baptist Convention and pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas, expressed his satisfaction with the Roe v. Wade ruling. “I have always felt that it was only after a child was born and had a life separate from its mother that it became an individual person,” the redoubtable fundamentalist declared, “and it has always, therefore, seemed to me that what is best for the mother and for the future should be allowed.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Religious Right wants to paint themselves as having always been anti-abortion, and tends to be quiet on their position about racism and civil rights. The Republicans have a history of inviting White Supremicist speakers to the Conservative Political Action Comitee, while at the same time trying to broaden their base to black voters. In fact, one of the biggest issues to galvinise white evangelical voters is opposition to the civil rights movement. Paul Weyrich of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress said:</p>

<blockquote><p>“What galvanised the Christian community was not abortion, school prayer, or the ERA. I am living witness to that because I was trying to get those people interested in those issues and I utterly failed. What changed their mind was Jimmy Carter’s intervention against the Christian schools, trying to deny them tax-exempt status on the basis of so-called de-facto segregation.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The religious right is now attempting to get black voters to join an anti-gay campaign, claiming that they were always on the side of civil rights. Matt Barber, the law dean of Liberty University (founded on pro-segregationalist grounds by Jerry Falwell) <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/matt-barber-whose-idol-backed-segregation-lectures-everyone-else-about-civil-rights-movement">claimed that the gay movement has &#8220;cynically co-opted and hijacked the language of the very, very noble civil rights movement and applied it to their disordered lifestyle.”</a></p>

<p>Next thing they&#8217;ll try and claim that Chrsitians have always been <a href="http://www.lva.virginia.gov/lib-edu/education/psd/nation/halifax.htm">against slavery</a>. When the Theistic Evolution crowd convinces more Christians of the scientific truth of evolution (that it is more than &#8220;just a theory&#8221;), they&#8217;ll claim that Christians always thought Genesis was compatible with science. And when the numbers of Americans opposing gay marriage drops they will next claim that they always supported gay rights. <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/survey-less-americans-believe-homosexuality-is-a-sin-nations-view-evolving-with-obamas-88141/">44% of Americans believed that homosexuality is a sin in September 2011, dropping to 37% in November 2012</a>, and <a href="http://www.lifeway.com/ArticleView?storeId=10054&amp;article=research-same-sex-marriage-civil-rights-issue-americans-say">64% think same-sex marriage is inevitable</a>. Is it because hollywood is pushing a campaign? Is it because political correctness is popular? Or is it because the media has exposed how, if evangelicals had their way, homosexuality would have the death penalty, like it is now in Uganda?</p>

<p>The more that Christians understand of their own history, the more they&#8217;ll start to realise that many of their key doctrines (like the idea that all of the bible is literally true and without error) are actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention_conservative_resurgence">new inventions</a>.</p>

<p>This dickhead is now <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/will-supreme-court-read-most-horrific-children-s-book-all-time">giving testimony to the US supreme court against marriage equality</a>, arguing homosexuality “is not an immutable characteristic&#8221;. His evidence mentions that he has authored a kid&#8217;s book on so-called gay &#8220;reparative therapy&#8221;, called Alfie&#8217;s Home. Here&#8217;s how he presents it:</p>

<blockquote><p>Alfie&#8217;s Home is the story of a boy who struggles with homosexuality well into his teenage years, then transitions naturally into heterosexuality after finding help and experiencing love in his family. This is the first resource of its kind for parents, teachers, students, counselors, clergy and anyone interested in helping children and adults heal their sexual identity.</p></blockquote>

<p>People for the American Way, a liberal advocacy group, call the book &#8221;<a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/will-supreme-court-read-most-horrific-children-s-book-all-time">the most horrifically disturbing children’s book we have ever seen</a>&#8221;. They describe the book:</p>

<blockquote><p> Alfie’s Home was published in 1993 by Cohen’s International Healing Foundation. It starts out with a picture of the protagonist on a boat with his dad.<br/>
 <img src="/images/Alfie-cover.jpg" alt="Alfie's Home Cover" />
 But it goes bad fast, going right for the right-wing myth that homosexuality is caused by childhood sexual abuse…<br/>
 <img src="/images/Alfie-6-7.jpg" alt="Alfie's Home p6-7" />
 …and by insufficiently attentive parents:<br/>
 <img src="/images/Alfie-8-9.jpg" alt="Alfie's Home p8-9" />
 Eventually, Alfie seeks help and takes part in the “touch therapy” advocated by Cohen…<br/>
 <img src="/images/Alfie-18-19.jpg" alt="Alfie's Home p18-19" />
 …which leads him to “realize that I’m not gay” and start dating a woman:<br/>
 <img src="/images/Alfie-24-25.jpg" alt="Alfie's Home p24-25" /></p></blockquote>

<p>I find it disturbing that they&#8217;re allowed to publish this book. Especially when you consider the list of most commonly challenged books is one where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_Tango_Makes_Three">a penguin has two dads</a>:</p>

<p>On assylum seekers:</p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;These people aren’t so much seeking asylum, they’re seeking permanent residency. If they were happy with temporary protection visas, then they might be able to argue better that they were asylum seekers&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-08-22/tony-abbott-blames-carbon-tax-for-uncertainty/4216308">Interview with Leigh Sales, 22nd August 2012</a></p>

<blockquote><p> TONY ABBOTT: Yeah. Don’t forget Jesus drove the traders from the temple as well. Now, I mean, you know&#8230;<br/>
 TONY JONES: What’s the analogy?<br/>
 TONY ABBOTT: &#8230;Jesus didn’t say yes to everyone. I mean Jesus knew that there was a place for everything and it is not necessarily everyone’s place to come to Australia&#8230; Jesus was the best man who ever lived but that doesn’t mean that he said yes to everyone, that he was permissive to everything, and this idea that Jesus would say to every person who wanted to come to Australia, “Fine”, the door is open, I just don’t think is necessarily right</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s2859473.htm">From Q&amp;A 5 April 2010</a>. The statement was in response to a question &#8220;what would Jesus do&#8221; on assylum seekers, which unfortunately goaded Abbott into likening himself to Jesus. One bible&#8217;s footnote suggests Jesus drove out the temple traders because &#8220;Not only were the religious leaders robbing the people financially, but because of this they had also robbed them spiritually by stealing from them the opportunity to come to know God genuinely.&#8221; In many ways it&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.unchristian.com/pdfs/Too_Political.pdf">right wing co-opting religion that is a major factor in young generations ditching Christianity</a>.</p>

<p>On rights at work:</p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;If we’re honest, most of us would accept that a bad boss is a little bit like a bad father or a bad husband … you find that he tends to do more good than harm. He might be a bad boss but at least he’s employing someone while he is in fact a boss.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p> I believe that there is a vast moral gulf which separates modern Australia from Nazi Germany. But can we be so sure that, under pressure over time, we will not slide down the same slippery slope. We only have to look at the abortion situation in this country. When abortion was in effect made legal, it was supposed to happen only when the physical or mental health of the mother was threatened; yet we all know—let us not fool ourselves—that there is now abortion on demand in this country. Something that was supposed to happen only in rare circumstances is now happening to the extent of 80,000 abortions a year in Australia.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p> “If half the effort were put into discouraging teenage promiscuity as goes into preventing teenage speeding, there might be fewer abortions, fewer traumatised young women and fewer dysfunctional families.”</p>

<p> “Why isn’t the fact that 100,000 women choose to end their pregnancies regarded as a national tragedy approaching the scale, say, of Aboriginal life expectancy being 20 years less than that of the general community?”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;In Australia, as elsewhere, one of the great totems of liberation from authority has been abortion on demand. Spurred by pictures of 12-week-old unborn babies being dismembered, some women’s activists have started to question the abortion culture. Abortion may not be the precise moral equivalent of infanticide but it’s not just removing an inconvenient wart or cyst either.<br/>
Since 1996, contrary to poltical correctness, the Australian parliament has overturned right-to-kill laws and (almost) banned gay marriage. Perhaps a political constituency may even be starting to emerge to ban abortions after 20 weeks. Thoughtful feminists are starting to grieve over the downstream consequences of sexual freedom.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

But children should not be presumed to be the best judges of their own long-term interests and should not have the right to go behind their parents’ backs… The real issue here is whether 14 and 15-year-olds can make informed decisions about what is right and wrong for them.

<blockquote><p> &#8220;It’s the responsibility of government to try to put policies in place which over time will allow people to improve their situation. But we can’t abolish poverty because poverty in part is a function of individual behaviour.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Quentin Tarantino&#8217;s latest spaghetti western and blaxploitation inspired film. QT takes on the brutality of the slave culture in the antebellum South as he did the Holocaust in <strong>Inglorious Basterds</strong>. Christoph Waltz played a German in both films, giving a much more convincing performance in Django as Dr Shultz, a bounty hunter who hates slavers. Through his partnership with freed slave Django (Jamie Foxx) they go on a blood soaked rampage for justice and vengeance. Ebert calls the ending a &#8220;satisfactory Quentonian celebration of violence&#8221;. Django has been criticised for excessive on-screen violence and a release date two weeks from the Conneticuit mass murder. Of course this is a <a href="/blog/2013/01/20/rick-perry/">standard diversionary tactic against real political action</a>. QT&#8217;s use of grindhouse storytelling leaves moralisers in a panic and fans and critics expressing strong approval in a measured fashion. Tarantino has also come under fire for the script&#8217;s frequent use of the n-word, which <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-jamie-foxx-django-unchained-n-word-leonardo-dicaprio-20121220,0,2556146.story">the actors found uncomfortable</a>. QT tackles the heavy subject of slavery without succumbing to moralising, creating entertainment (with unexpectedly humorous scenes) for a wide audience. And in some ways, that&#8217;s probably why conservatives hate it.</p>

<p>Throughout film history audiences have been influenced by abridged accounts of historical events. Discussing <strong>Battleship Potemkin</strong>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battleship_Potemkin#The_Odessa_Steps_sequence">Roger Ebert writes</a>,</p>

<blockquote><p>That there was, in fact, no czarist massacre on the Odessa Steps scarcely diminishes the power of the scene &#8230; It is ironic that [Eisenstein] did it so well that today, the bloodshed on the Odessa steps is often referred to as if it really happened.</p></blockquote>

<p>There&#8217;s been a strong critic reaction to <strong>Zero Dark Thirty</strong> with its positive portrayal of &#8220;enhanced interrogation techniques&#8221;, with an ex-CIA official calling the movie <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2013/jan/14/oscars-boycott-zero-dark-thirty">an &#8220;infomercial&#8221; for their techniques</a>. The film does not explicitly say that torture helped to gain information to capture Bin Laden, it only makes that suggestion by designating half an hour at the start of the film to interrogations. Even people who know that no information was gained on Bin Laden through torture, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/01/zero-dark-thirty-debate-torture-has-no-place-in-a-civilized-society/">presenting it as a standard part of a modern intelligence operation is morally dubious</a>.</p>

<p>The history shows not only did torture fail to produce useful information other than what was already gained without using &#8220;enhanced&#8221; techniques, faulty information <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/23/opinion/la-oe-1223-mcdermott-torture-bigelow-zero-dark-20121223">sent the CIA on a wild goose chase</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The simple fact is you can&#8217;t reliably separate the gold from the dross that torture yields. &#8220;He had us chasing the goddamn geese in Central Park because he said some of them had explosives stuffed up their ass,&#8221; one FBI counter-terrorism agent said in frustration</p></blockquote>

<p>Audiences of historical fiction should be mindful that the presentation of events they see may have little to do with actual history. When one of Django&#8217;s characters, the ugly, sadistic Big John Brittle starts whipping a black slave girl for breaking eggs while holding a bible in his left hand and recounting scripture, I was dubious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction#Jules.27s_Bible_passage">given Tarantino&#8217;s history of making up bible passages</a>. Lo and behold, the text of the bible passage is accurate, Genesis 9:2 &#8220;The fear of ye, and the dread of ye, shall be on every beast of the Earth&#8221;. Some have questioned whether Tarantino, an atheist, is laying it on a bit thick by with Brittle having three pages from the bible sewn to his clothes while being an outlaw wanted dead or alive.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/dj-145.jpeg" title="Big John Brittle shot in Django Unchained" ></p>

<p>But really, considering the context, this isn&#8217;t pantomime at all. Students of the pseudoscience of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology">phrenology</a> considered the brains of Europeans the &#8220;most beautiful&#8221; when compared to &#8220;lesser&#8221; races, as blacks lacked the part of the brain capable of producing artists. Considering Genesis 9, the biblical account of the result of Yahweh&#8217;s global flood is that the world must be repopulated from Noah&#8217;s descendents, Shem, Ham and Japeth.</p>

<blockquote><p> Noah, a man of the soil, began to plant a vineyard. <em>21</em> When he drank some of the wine, he got drunk and uncovered himself inside his tent. <em>22</em> Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father&#8217;s nakedness and told his two brothers who were outside. <em>23</em> Shem and Japheth took the garment and placed it on their shoulders. Then they walked in backwards and covered up their father&#8217;s nakedness. Their faces were turned the other way so they did not see their father&#8217;s nakedness.</p>

<p> 24 When Noah awoke from his drunken stupor he learned what his youngest son had done to him. 25 So he said,</p>

<p> &#8220;Cursed be Canaan!<br/>
 The lowest of slaves<br/>
 he will be to his brothers.&#8221; <br/>
 26 He also said,</p>

<p> &#8220;Worthy of praise is the LORD, the God of Shem! <br/>
 May Canaan be the slave of Shem!<br/>
 27 May God enlarge Japheth&#8217;s territory and numbers!<br/>
 May he live in the tents of Shem <br/>
 and may Canaan be his slave!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>And so because Ham didn&#8217;t cover up his father&#8217;s nakedness, instead left his father&#8217;s tent to tell his brothers and laugh at his father (and possibly bring out Noah&#8217;s garment to show his brothers, before they honourably bring back &#8220;the garment&#8221;) all of Ham&#8217;s descendants are cursed to be the <strong>עֶבֶד עֲבָדִים eved avadim</strong>, the lowest of slaves. The curse is pronounced on Canaan, not Ham.</p>

<p>While Genesis 9 only mentiones the Canaanites (Phoenecia/Palestine) as the people group under the curse of slavery from Ham, Genesis 10:6 also mentions the Cush (Nubia/Ethiopia), Mizraim (Egypt) and Put (Libya). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Ham">Traditional Christian understanding asserts that Japheth went on to father the people group that became Western Europeans and Caucasians</a>. Therefore this simplistic literal understanding of Genesis has been used for generations to support the idea that black people were under a curse from God to serve the white people as slaves. Unfortunately this is <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/texas-public-school-course-teaches-racial-origins-traced-noah">still being taught as gospel in Southern public schools</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/RacialOriginsNoah.jpg" title="Racial Origins from Noah's Decendents" ></p>

<p>The belief that African people are born to serve Caucasians as the &#8216;lowest of slaves&#8217; is alive and well in Texas. How do these types respond to the film? <a href="http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2012/12/12/the-conservative-backlash-against-django-unchained-began-today">With widespread admiration, of course</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Django Unchained is hard-core Cultural Marxism. Supporters of this doctrine believe that the best way to get the American public to accept Marxism and Totalitarianism is to denigrate, defame, and ridicule Western Civilization, moral values, Christianity, and the family unit. It was devised by the Frankfurt School in the 1930s.</p>

<p>The movie is being released on Christmas Day as a way of denigrating Christmas and the Christian faith.</p>

<p>Jamie Foxx, the star of Django Unchained is promoting the movie by going on anti-white racial rants in public. This weekend, on Saturday Night Live, he stated “I get to kill all the white people, how great is that!”</p></blockquote>

<p>Other than slavery being banned in the South, the only thing that seems to have changed is that now they have to call heroic black figures &#8216;socialist&#8217; when in public. I bet they&#8217;ll love the next 4 years.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>John Dickson&#8217;s <a href="http://sydneyanglicans.net/blogs/culture/a-surprising-consensus">stirring up some trouble by suggesting that women should be allowed to preach in church</a>. The idea that evangelicals are still discussing this in the 21st centuary is patently ridiculous, but Dickson is stepping in to offer a biblical basis for letting women preach modern sermons without becoming priests. His argument is that if Paul&#8217;s prohibition on permitting women to teach men authoritatively does not prohibit exortation or prophesy. The word &#8216;didaskos&#8217; (from learning, as in autodidact) is used by Paul with high specificity of &#8216;guarding the apostolic deposit&#8217;, therefore it is unclear what level of teaching women are prevented from performing. The crux is that most modern sermons have some teaching and some exhortation. Michael Jensen warns against &#8216;theologising our traditions&#8217;, but the book has provoked a small backlash (more of a whimper than a bang).</p>

<p>When Johannes Gutenberg created the printing press he had many things to say about its ability to spread orthodoxy thoughout the world.</p>

<blockquote><p>It is a press, certainly, but a press from which shall flow in inexhaustible streams&#8230;Through it, God will spread His Word. A spring of truth shall flow from it: like a new star it shall scatter the darkness of ignorance, and cause a light heretofore unknown to shine amongst men.</p>

<p>God suffers in the multitude of souls whom His word can not reach. Religious truth is imprisoned in a small number of manuscript books which confine instead of spread the public treasure. Let us break the seal which seals up holy things and give wings to Truth in order that she may win every soul that comes into the world by her word no longer written at great expense by hands easily palsied, but multiplied like the wind by an untiring machine.</p></blockquote>

<p>The printing press wasn&#8217;t just used to print bibles, it was used to print <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/274/pg274.html">Luther&#8217;s 95 Theses</a>. What was thesis 90?</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>To repress these arguments and scruples of the laity by force alone, and not to resolve them by giving reasons, is to expose the Church and the pope to the ridicule of their enemies, and to make Christians unhappy.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>And how do people <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R2T1RLYJM4U3TV">respond to John Dickson</a>?</p>

<blockquote><p>This book does not line up with scriptural truth, so that is why I give it the lowest rating. I would say it is full of &#8220;thumb sucking theology&#8221; - where the writer &#8220;sucks it out of his thumb&#8221; because he has to; there is not sound biblical support for his view. Reject this. Discard it, no matter how well it might be written.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some others have suggested that the layity should not be allowed to have access to the secret knowledge of Greek and Hebrew, because, then how will they understand English words in their bible? This painfully naive argument overlooks the reality of changing communications technology and how that will inevitably change the way the laity interacts with the church. It also ignores that bible translations satisfy a political agenda - case in point, the KJV has only 2 instances of the word &#8216;slave&#8217;</p>

<p>In fact, King James <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorized_King_James_Version#Considerations_for_a_new_version">authorised his version because he found the marginal notes in the Geneva translation offensive</a>, praising the civil disobedience of the Hebrew midwives in Exodus 1:19. The king also gave the translators instructions designed to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology of the Church of England.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like what this author has to say so I don&#8217;t want anyone to read it&#8221; stopped working in 1517, but evangelicals keep trying these counterproductive &#8221;<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/christopher-latondresse/farewell-rob-bell-or-john_b_829409.html">Farewell, Rob Bell</a>&#8221; hatchet jobs.</p>

<blockquote><p>Rob Bell now stands alongside a growing pantheon of brothers in Christ &#8211; Greg Boyd, Brian McLaren and N.T. Wright among them &#8211; who Piper has thrown under the bus (and even called &#8220;heretics&#8221;) simply because their theology doesn&#8217;t neatly jibe with his own.</p>

<p>For a generation harboring increasingly negative perceptions about (and distancing itself from) Christianity, there&#8217;s no question that controversies like these have played a big role in making these trends worse. When asked to describe present-day Christianity, the second most reported description of young people (ages 16 to 29) was that it is &#8220;too-judgmental,&#8221; with 87 percent of young non-churchgoers and 52 percent of churchgoers holding this view.</p></blockquote>

<p>When Rachel Held evans was writing a book on feminism, <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/on-rachel-held-evans-and-why-vagina-gate-matters/">she was asked to drop the two references to the word vagina to appease Lifeway</a>. Lifeway are the bookstore arm of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention">Southern Baptist Convention, an evangelical group set up over slave-holding rights</a>, so good luck publishing a book saying that if Christians don&#8217;t take stoning non-virgins to death on their wedding night seriously, maybe <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/unreasonablefaith/2011/07/thoughts-on-driscoll/">dumb ideas about women baking</a> <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2013/01/mark-driscoll-on-stay-at-home-dads.html">need to die out</a> <a href="http://www.nakedpastor.com/2012/01/17/mark-driscoll-in-hell/">as well</a>. Despite the book not being listed by lifeway, A Year of Biblical Womanhood made it onto the <a href="http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/why-a-year-of-biblical-womanhood-is-a-nyt-bestseller">New York Times top 18th e-book bestseller</a>. A clear victory for vaginas everywhere, and a defeat for those that want to censor Christianity into decrepitude with outdated ideas about book buying.</p>

<p>The saddest thing about the issue is how much Dickson is not saying. What&#8217;s it going to be, another 10 years of Sydney Anglicans dragging their feet on women in any real ministry roles? Yes, that&#8217;s right, I said real; get used to it. If you can&#8217;t confront the reality that the current situation is actually shitty for women you won&#8217;t be able to confront the reality that Sydney Anglicans will be a <a href="/blog/2012/12/07/ncls2011">vestige of its former glory</a>. And I&#8217;m not sure what to think about it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rick Perry, governer of Texas has come out against gun control, suggesting to Christians that <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/50484736/ns/local_news-dallas_fort_worth_tx/t/gov-rick-perry-responds-obama-gun-control-order/#.UPkB8dc-vZg">prayer works better than gun control</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p> Guns require a finger to pull the trigger. The sad young man who did that in Newtown was clearly haunted by demons and no gun law could have saved the children in Sandy Hook Elementary from his terror.</p>

<p> There is evil prowling in the world – it shows up in our movies, video games and online fascinations, and finds its way into vulnerable hearts and minds. As a free people, let us choose what kind of people we will be.  Laws, the only redoubt of secularism, will not suffice.  Let us all return to our places of worship and pray for help. Above all, let us pray for our children.</p>

<p> In fact, the piling on by the political left, and their cohorts in the media, to use the massacre of little children to advance a pre-existing political agenda that would not have saved those children, disgusts me, personally.  The second amendment to the Constitution is a basic right of free people and cannot be nor will it be abridged by the executive power of this or any other president.</p></blockquote>

<p>Perry claims that &#8220;no gun law could have saved the children in Sandy Hook Elementary from his terror&#8221;. Even if the killer Lanza was possessed by a demon, gun laws do indeed save lives. On the same day as the Sandy Hook killings, a mentally ill man in the Chinese provence of Guanxi <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/12/15/not-just-sandy-hook-china-s-terrifying-knife-attacks.html">wounded 22 children in a school stabbing rampage</a>. All of the children survived. To say that gun laws have no effect is nonsense, and the Chinese example proves that it is easier to eliminate firearms in a society than mental health issues.</p>

<p>If Rick Perry believes that laws are a &#8220;redoubt of secularism&#8221; then we must ask, what is the function of the governor of a state other than to create laws to make her citizens safe and prosperous? If it is to call citizens to &#8220;pray for help&#8221;, I think he&#8217;s confused the state for the church. A common mistake among born-again Christians these days.</p>

<p>To blame a lack of prayer reliance on God for these tragedies is a slap in the face of the victims and their families who attended church before or after the shooting. In fact, religion may be more a part of the <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/death-violence-and-america-is-god-the-answer-or-the-problem/">problem of violence than the solution</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>When American Christians are more supportive of weapons, war and torture than their unbelieving neighbors, something has gone terribly wrong. When the greatest amount of violence is found precisely in the region of the country where church membership and attendance is the highest we might ask what kind of influence Christians are exerting. Complaints about a lack of official prayer in schools or an absence of religious symbols in the public square don’t get even close to identifying the source of the violence problem.</p></blockquote>

<p>Rather than discussing real solutions to mental health issues, Perry goes on to blame the entertainment industry and &#8220;evil prowling in the world&#8221;. Violent video games and movies have long been criticized for inspiring murders. After the 1999 mass murder in Columbine, Franklin Graham commented that the <a href="http://extras.denverpost.com/news/chs0416p.htm">tragedy has strengthened his belief that guns aren&#8217;t to blame for gun violence</a>. Rather, Graham said that the entertainment industry is &#8220;awash in killings, shootings and rapes. We are complete fools if we don&#8217;t think that today&#8217;s entertainment has poisoned a generation. I&#8217;ve always believed this but I believe it more now.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is a smattering of research showing a tenuous correlation between violent media and anti-social behaviour, but there is no proof of causation. Given that the entertainment industry has most of their products protected under free speech rights in the First Amendment to the US Constitution, it&#8217;s dissapointing that the governor has not sought genuine solutions 13 years on.</p>

<div class="figure"><a href="http://www.nakedpastor.com/2013/01/15/guns-and-peace/"><img src="/images/nakedpastor-guns.jpg" link="http://www.nakedpastor.com/2013/01/15/guns-and-peace/" title="Guns and Peace by David Hayward of NakedPastor.com" ><p>Guns and Peace by David Hayward of NakedPastor.com</span></a></div>


<p>The abuse of religion by the far right in America is a phenomenon that is drawing more and more negative attention. When evangelical leaders called school shootings <a href="/blog/2013/01/03/rentier-theology/">god&#8217;s will</a> many Christians cautiously distance themselves. Unfortunately while some have downplayed the significance of <a href="http://www.outofur.com/archives/2013/01/no_were_not_a_h.html">a few &#8220;crazy uncles&#8221; and insist that mainstream Christianity is not a hate group</a>, Perry joining the chorus is not going to help.</p>

<p>Albert Mohler described the Republican loss of the 2012 presidential race as an &#8221;<a href="http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/real-evangelical-disaster">evangelical disaster</a>&#8221;. Rachel Held Evans responded that &#8220;the great evangelical disaster is that evangelicalism has become synonymous with Republicanism rather than the gospel of Jesus Christ.&#8221; Gun control measures like <a href="http://www.people-press.org/2013/01/14/in-gun-control-debate-several-options-draw-majority-support/">universal background checks supported by 85% of Republicans</a>. I&#8217;d say that the real disaster is that evangelicalism is being used as an excuse, or worse, as a justification to push political inaction on something the majority of the country wants because the NRA is lining their pockets. If Christians don&#8217;t change their trajectory, I don&#8217;t think there will be much of a church left in another 13 years. And the only explanation they&#8217;ll have for it is to blame violent video games for &#8220;corrupting the youth&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s common to hear right wing editorials and chain letters advancing arguments to the effect that if society only did X (like they did in the &#8220;good old days&#8221;) then every social ill would be cured. This commonly plays on misconceptions based on alarmist media reports that <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/150464/Americans-Believe-Crime-Worsening.aspx">violence in Western societies is getting worse</a> while in reality violent crime <a href="http://edge.org/conversation/mc2011-history-violence-pinker">is at the lowest levels ever thoughout the West</a>.</p>

<p>Many people think that <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2012/s3511023.htm">crime in the Australia is worsening</a>, and that the majority of crime involves violence. Unfortunately, the media frequently presents <a href="http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/Lawlink/bocsar/ll_bocsar.nsf/vwFiles/CJB153.pdf/$file/CJB153.pdf">misleading commentary on crime figures</a>, suggesting that small localised variations in crime rates are indicitive of a trend towards mayhem and chaos. This has lead to an evaporation of public confidence in the <a href="http://aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/tandi/381-400/tandi387/view%20paper.html">ability for the criminal justice system to deal with crime fairly and adequately</a>. A study of Tasmanian jurors found that while 80% of the public believe that courts are too lenient in sentencing, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/1128_aic.pdf">90% of of jurors informed on information about crime cases thought that the judge in the case gave an adequate sentence</a>.</p>

<p>Despite the reality that courts are generally in line with Australian expectations on crime sentencing, misinformed conservatives are pushing in various states for mandatory minimum sentences, based on the idea that politicians, pundits and focus groups know more about how to deal with crime than lawyers, academics and judges. These policies would <a href="http://newmatilda.com/2012/07/13/campbells-tick-and-flick-government">dramatically increase the prison population</a>, putting pressure on the public corrections system to build more prisons. Private prison companies would likely be commissioned to increase prisons capacity at lower cost. But as <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/08/private_prisons">The Economist warns</a>, &#8220;The great hazard of contracting out incarceration &#8220;services&#8221; is that private firms may well turn out to be even more efficient and effective than unions in lobbying for policies that would increase prison populations.&#8221;</p>

<p>This has indeed happend in America, not just with prisons lobbying government to maintain &#8220;demand&#8221; for their services, but directly <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/06/matt-stoller-who-wants-keep-the-war-on-drugs-going-and-put-you-in-debtors-prison.html">bribing judges to increase the sentences for offenders</a>. The for profit prisons industry is concerned that &#8220;any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them.&#8221; They also list good policing as a risk to their business: &#8220;reductions in crime rates or resources dedicated to prevent and enforce crime could lead to reductions in arrests, convictions and sentences requiring incarceration at correctional facilities.&#8221; As the saying goes, if you&#8217;re not part of the solution, prolong the problem for as long as possible.</p>

<p>The next time you hear a conservative pundit decrying the &#8220;softness&#8221; of judges and insisting on &#8220;tough on crime&#8221; policies you should ask yourself: &#8220;is this supported by the evidence?&#8221; And if not, what&#8217;s behind this? Who benefits? Is it simply incompetence or is it malice? Is it just yellow journalism to sell tabloids or is there an economic incentive in perpetuating the misinformation that violent crime is on the rise, or that current drug policy is working?</p>

<p>Often those pushing a conservative moral argument <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootleggers_and_Baptists">have no idea where their financial backing comes from</a>. Politics makes for strange bedfellows, with polticians often acting as a go-between with conservative moralisers and those with a financial agenda. During the prohibition era, Baptists were known to ally in their support of alcohol bans with bootleggers that profited from them. The preachers wanted to ban alcohol so that church wouldn&#8217;t compete with pubs on the &#8220;Lord&#8217;s day&#8221;. The bootleggers wanted their monopoly on the sale of alcohol. It leads to faulty theology like this, a billboard encouraging voters in a dry town not to legalise the sale of alcohol, saying that a vote for legal alcohol is a re-crucifixion of Jesus.
<img src="../images/BaptistsAndBootleggers.jpg" title="Baptists and Bootleggers" alt="Baptists and Bootleggers" /></p>

<p>A minor problem with this sign is that it&#8217;s not only hysterical, it&#8217;s completely unbiblical. The sign references Hebrews 10:29, which warns that church-goers who &#8220;deliberately keep on sinning&#8221; can be guilty of re-crucifying Jesus drink communion wine in an unworthy manner (&#8220;profaning the blood of the covenant&#8221;). To say that this prohibits the sale of alcohol for non-religious consumption is a misapplication of scripture. Most Christian denominations support the moderate consumption of alcohol (but condemn drunkenness). Jesus turned water into wine at a wedding party, and Ecclesiastes 9:7 instructs, “Drink your wine with a merry heart.” Psalm 104:14-15 states that God gives wine “that makes glad the heart of men.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately many who want to push Christian morality into government policy end up pushing their own brand of legalism. And the Christian leaders most willing to publicise an unbiblical message are likely to be the ones lacking the moral scrupules or common sense to question where the money for their campaign comes from.</p>

<p>Exactly the same tends to happen with the <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/abortion-politically-decisive-christians-election-sin/">emotionally charged abortion rights debate</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, the abortion issue has allowed many Christians – and conservatives as a whole – to claim to be working to defend the most vulnerable when in fact they are turning attention and national resources away from those who are most desperately in need. The good that actually could be done to protect life isn’t done because pro-life Christians lend their support to politicians who are most likely to block funding for programs for children and families of the weakest and most impoverished. The abortion issue ends up serving as a smokescreen behind which certain politicians work in the interests of those who are the most rich and powerful.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many have examined the positions they took in <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2012/10/how-i-lost-faith-in-the-pro-life-movement.html">the pro-life movement and found them be factually bankrupt on closer inspection</a>.</p>

<p>When over 20 kindergarten students were killed in a mass shooting in Newtown, Conneticuit, many evangelical leaders expressed a belief that the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/17/james-dobson-connecticut-shooting-gay-marriage_n_2318015.html">tragedy was a result of God&#8217;s will</a>. James Dobson, founder of Focus on the Family had this to say about the cause of the shooting:</p>

<blockquote><p>We have turned our back on God. millions of people have decided that God doesn&#8217;t exist, or he&#8217;s irrelevant to me and we have killed 54 million babies and the institution of marriage is right on the verge of a complete redefinition. Believe me, that is going to have consequences, too&#8230;
I think we have turned our back on the Scripture and on God Almighty and I think he has allowed judgment to fall upon us. I think that’s what is going on.</p></blockquote>

<p>Bryan Fischer, host of a popular American Family Association radio show, said on Friday that God did not protect the Sandy Hook&#8217;s victims because prayer had been kicked out of public school in the &#8217;60s. Former GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee said Americans should not be surprised at the tragedy because &#8220;we have sytematically removed God from our schools.&#8221;</p>

<p>Franklin Graham, the son of Billy Graham and the CEO of the Samaritan&#8217;s Purse charity said that Americans &#8220;shouldn&#8217;t be shocked&#8221; at the mass murder because of violent video games and that God has been &#8220;removed&#8221; from public schools.</p>

Franklin Graham blames the Sandy Hook massacre on television, music, video games, and the removal of God from public school.</div>
</div>


<p>Sam Morris, a Tennessee pastor believes the shootings are the result of schools teaching that &#8220;humanism&#8221; means that students are God and Lanza, the serial killer &#8220;can just go blow up anybody he wants&#8221;. He also said they teach <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/12/17/tennessee-pastor-mass-shootings-because-schools-teach-evolution-and-how-to-be-a-homo/">evolution and &#8220;how to be a homo&#8221;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>when you kicked God out of schools, you’re going to be judged for that.</p>

<p>When I got in high school, man, I started learning all this kingdom, phylum stuff, all this junk about evolution&#8230; evolution teaches — here’s the bottom line — that you’re an animal&#8230;</p>

<p>So, here you are, you’re an animal and you’re a god! So, what are we going to teach you about in school? Well, we can teach you about sex, we can teach you how to rebel to you parents, we can teach you how to be a homo! But we’re definitely not going to teach you about the word of God! Amen.</p></blockquote>

<p>Blaming school shootings on God, the devil or secularism has been going on for as long as school shootings in America. After the Columbine tragedy, the father of one of the deceased had the poor judgement to state &#8220;Columbine was not just a tragedy &#8211; it was a spiritual event&#8221; After hurricane Katrina struck, Billy Graham&#8217;s daughter remarked &#8220;we&#8217;ve been telling God to get out of our schools, to get out of our government and to get out of our lives. And being the gentleman He is, I believe He has calmly backed out.&#8221; In fact, you can be sure that Christians have been saying that &#8220;God is a gentleman&#8221; since the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Siloam">tower of Siloam fell</a>.</p>

<p>A number of Christians have commented on the <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/sandy-hook-and-the-tearing-asunder-of-evangelical-christianity/">right wing fundamentalists that now control evangelical Christianity and their theology</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>To blame a lack of reliance on God for this most recent tragedy is a slap in the face of the victims and their families who attended church before or after the shooting&#8230; If Christians want to place blame, blame the culture of violence—not the Prince of Peace</p>

<p>We do not need the government forcing us to say officially-sanctioned prayers in school each day.  Do we think being forced to say a prayer is any prayer at all?  Do we think that in the not-so-distant days of Christendom, when all members of society were considered “Christian” and our nations were “Christian,” that faith was genuine? We have come so far and need to respect the rights of other religious traditions.  We argue for freedom for our missionaries to evangelize in Islamic countries but then we want to remake America in their same restrictive mold.  Sure, today, our faith is sometimes looked down upon, marginalized, and spat on—but the church is in a much better place now that we have regained the pre-Constantinian role of sojourners in a sinful world rather than the inquisitors of godless governments.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many Christian leaders are also pointing out that ultimately the arguments about school prayer and God&#8217;s will are designed to <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/death-violence-and-america-is-god-the-answer-or-the-problem/">take attention away from the discourse about effective regulations to prevent future tragedies</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>When American Christians are more supportive of weapons, war and torture than their unbelieving neighbors, something has gone terribly wrong. When the greatest amount of violence is found precisely in the region of the country where church membership and attendance is the highest we might ask what kind of influence Christians are exerting. Complaints about a lack of official prayer in schools or an absence of religious symbols in the public square don’t get even close to identifying the source of the violence problem.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s common to see specious arguments claiming to know the mind of God being forwarded by hayseeders who don&#8217;t understand the interests co-opting their agenda. These stooges frustratingly lack the ability to ask simple questions like, &#8216;Is this biblical?&#8217; or &#8216;who benefits?&#8217;. Younger Christians that question the political rhetoric of the evangelical churches they find themselves in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/brian-d-mclaren/why-do-evangelicals-disli_b_517094.html">remain quiet about it, fearing ostracization</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many are afraid to admit that they voted for Barack Obama, or believe in evolution, or are concerned about global climate change, or are OK with their friends being gay or priests being married, or use birth control, or wish women could be treated as equals in their church, or don&#8217;t take every word of the Bible as having equal authority and historical accuracy. If they speak up, they will be shunned by their religious authorities &#8211; and zapped by their fellow Christians who have been told to press the punishment button when anyone dares to differ by giving the &#8220;wrong&#8221; answer. So they comply.</p></blockquote>

<p>They comply until the evangelicals pushing an increasingly overt right wing political agenda give them more and more reasons to leave.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This bullshit has been going around on Facebook:</p>

<blockquote><p>Very insightful and very true&#8230;.Take a second to read this:</p>

<p>Apparently the White House referred to Christmas Trees as “Holiday Trees” for the first time this year which prompted CBS presenter, Ben Stein, to present this piece which I would like to share with you. I think it applies just as much to many countries as it does to America &#8230;</p>

<p>The following was written by Ben Stein and recited by him on CBS Sunday Morning Commentary.</p>

<p>My confession:</p>

<p>I am a Jew, and every single one of my ancestors was Jewish. And it does not bother me even a little bit when people call those beautiful lit up, bejewelled trees, Christmas trees. I don&#8217;t feel threatened. I don&#8217;t feel discriminated against. That&#8217;s what they are, Christmas trees.</p></blockquote>

<p>Stein loves to wear Judaism on his shoulder, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stein#Dominique_Strauss-Kahn">likening Obama and all proponents of science education as Nazis</a>. Talking about his &#8220;intelligent design&#8221; propaganda movie Stien said &#8220;Love of God and compassion and empathy leads you to a very glorious place, and science leads you to killing people.&#8221; The Anti-Defamation League issued a statement condemning the film&#8217;s misuse of the Holocaust and its imagery, &#8220;Using the Holocaust in order to tarnish those who promote the theory of evolution is outrageous and trivializes the complex factors that led to the mass extermination of European Jewry&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote><p>It doesn&#8217;t bother me a bit when people say, “Merry Christmas” to me. I don&#8217;t think they are slighting me or getting ready to put me in a ghetto. In fact, I kind of like it. It shows that we are all brothers and sisters celebrating this happy time of year. It doesn&#8217;t bother me at all that there is a manger scene on display at a key intersection near my beach house in Malibu. If people want a crib, it&#8217;s just as fine with me as is the Menorah a few hundred yards away.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whether he personally likes Christian imagery in public has no bearing on whether it is constitutional to use government money or government property to put up religious displays.</p>

<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t like getting pushed around for being a Jew, and I don&#8217;t think Christians like getting pushed around for being Christians. I think people who believe in God are sick and tired of getting pushed around, period. I have no idea where the concept came from, that America is an explicitly atheist country. I can&#8217;t find it in the Constitution and I don&#8217;t like it being shoved down my throat.</p></blockquote>

<p>Stein misrepresents the first amendment, which clearly states &#8220;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion&#8221;. This means that public money and public property cannot be used to establish a church, and cannot be used to promote any one religion. That&#8217;s why there are no prayers in US public schools, and no ten commandments in US courthouses.</p>

<blockquote><p>Or maybe I can put it another way: where did the idea come from that we should worship celebrities and we aren&#8217;t allowed to worship God? I guess that&#8217;s a sign that I&#8217;m getting old, too. But there are a lot of us who are wondering where these celebrities came from and where the America we knew went to.</p></blockquote>

<p>Separation of church and state doesn&#8217;t prevent any individual from practicing their religion or worshipping any God. It just means that the government isn&#8217;t allowed to insist to Hindu students that they must worship and Abrahamic God (&#8220;You shall have no other Gods except me&#8221;). The idea that the &#8220;America we knew&#8221; was a better place is a classic argument of conservatives, and is simply false, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect">the highest IQ on average ever</a>, and the <a href="http://edge.org/conversation/mc2011-history-violence-pinker">lowest rates of crime and violence ever</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>In light of the many jokes we send to one another for a laugh, this is a little different: This is not intended to be a joke; it&#8217;s not funny, it&#8217;s intended to get you thinking.</p>

<p>Billy Graham&#8217;s daughter was interviewed on the Early Show and Jane Clayson asked her: “How could God let something like this happen?” (regarding Hurricane Katrina). Anne Graham gave an extremely profound and insightful response. She said: “I believe God is deeply saddened by this, just as we are, but for years we&#8217;ve been telling God to get out of our schools, to get out of our government and to get out of our lives. And being the gentleman He is, I believe He has calmly backed out. How can we expect God to give us His blessing and His protection if we demand He leave us alone?”</p></blockquote>

<p>Jesus makes it clear that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Siloam">tragedy and calamity is not divine retribution</a>. Lotz said exactly the <a href="http://www.prayerfoundation.org/billy_grahams_daughter.htm">same unbiblical shit after 9/11</a>. Bryan Fisher said the same thing after the Conneticuit shooting:</p>

</a>
<div class="video-info" >http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/fischer-god-didnt-stop-ct-school-shooting-because-hes-gentleman-who-doesnt-go-where-he-not-w

Bryan Fischer explains that the massacre at a Connecticut elementary school could have been stopped by God, but he has been kicked out of public schools and doesn&#8217;t go where he is not wanted.</div>
</div>


<blockquote><p>In light of recent events&#8230; terrorists attack, school shootings, etc. I think it started when Madeleine Murray O&#8217;Hare (she was murdered, her body found a few years ago) complained she didn&#8217;t want prayer in our schools, and we said OK. Then someone said you better not read the Bible in school. The Bible says thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, and love your neighbour as yourself. And we said OK.</p></blockquote>

<p>The American government did not say &#8220;OK&#8221; to one woman&#8217;s demands. They followed the US constitution, and removed any material in <em>public</em> schools that would represent an establishment of religion, which forces students to comply with a set religion. Students are allowed to pray in student-initiated prayers, but cannot be directed or compelled to pray by teachers. Teachers are allowed to read from the bible and discuss it as literature in lessons such as history.</p>

<p>One of the key features of a secular system of law and order is that nobody is above the law, it applies equally to all people. That means that a crime committed against someone you don&#8217;t like is a crime, and still deserves justice. When someone you don&#8217;t like is arrested, they still have the right to a fair trial and a legal defence. Murder is murder and will be punished by secular law whether the ten commandments are in schools or courthouses, or not, or the accused or the victim is a religious believer or not. To suggest otherwise suggests delighting in tragedy of people you hate, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_the_other_cheek">you might just remember Jesus preaching against</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Then Dr. Benjamin Spock said we shouldn&#8217;t spank our children when they misbehave, because their little personalities would be warped and we might damage their self-esteem (Dr. Spock&#8217;s son committed suicide). We said an expert should know what he&#8217;s talking about. And we said okay.</p></blockquote>

<p>Pulling out anecdotes of suffering reeks of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude">Schadenfreude</a>, and says nothing about whether the self-esteem movement is useful or not.</p>

<blockquote><p>Now we&#8217;re asking ourselves why our children have no conscience, why they don&#8217;t know right from wrong, and why it doesn&#8217;t bother them to kill strangers, their classmates, and themselves.</p>

<p>Probably, if we think about it long and hard enough, we can figure it out. I think it has a great deal to do with &#8216;WE REAP WHAT WE SOW.&#8217;</p>

<p>Funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world&#8217;s going to hell. Funny how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what the Bible says. Funny how you can send &#8216;jokes&#8217; through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice about sharing. Funny how lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene articles pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion of God is suppressed in the school and workplace.</p></blockquote>

<p>Because unlike what the religious right thinks, &#8220;freedom of religion&#8221; does not mean &#8221;<a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/does-randy-forbes-understand-how-first-amendment-works">nobody is allowed to criticise me</a>&#8221;. Most people who post this kind of content will go through life thinking that most people hate them for their religion. But when Christians go arond with a self-righteous phariseeism trying to criticise, blame and haras anyone who doesn&#8217;t agree with them (including people from their own faith), the real reason they&#8217;re hated is because they&#8217;re a douchebag.</p>
