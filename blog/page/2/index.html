  <div class="entry-content"><p>Dr Marrion Maddox spoke about the <a href="http://www.saintdavids.org.nz/FergusonLectureJune2006.pdf">rise of Christian fundamentalism in Australian politics</a> in 2006:</p>

<blockquote><p>Christian parties have existed in Australia for a long time, but, due to the robust two- party system, have seldom had much direct electoral influence18. The Christian Democratic Party (CDP) and its predecessor (Call to Australia) have been represented in the New South Wales upper house since 1981, but enjoyed their sole, fleeting federal presence for a few months in 1998.</p>

<p>The big news story of the 2004 federal election was the national launch of Adelaide- based minor party Family First (FFP). With one member already in the South Australian upper house, FFP ran federal candidates all over Australia. Despite a small primary vote, elaborate preference deals meant that the party had one Senator elected, Victorian Steve Fielding. Most of the candidates were members of one denomination, the Assemblies of God. Others, such as Fielding, came from related Pentecostal traditions. A few identified with other traditions, such as Catholic. Despite these connections, the party emphatically portrayed itself as a ‘family values’ party, rejecting suggestions that it is a ‘Christian party’. Party events sometimes resemble church functions, and vice versa20, but the party’s website scrupulously avoids religious references, leading even other Christian parties to allege duplicity on FFP’s part21. The media image of FFP as a Christian party has persisted, despite official denials. For example, on the Sunday morning after the election, when it appeared FFP might have the balance of power in the Senate, veteran television journalist Laurie Oakes proposed that FFP’s success marked ‘the arrival of the religious right in Australian politics’.</p>

<p>However, despite the huge media fascination it generated, FFP was only ever a sideshow in Australian religious right politics. Far more significant was the positioning of the Liberal Party increasingly towards the religious right, which, as I document in detail in my book God Under Howard: The Rise of the Religious Right in Australian Politics23 , had been underway since the formation of the federal Liberal Party’s socially conservative, ambiguously-Christian Lyons Forum pressure group in the early 1990s.  Religious priming (known journalistically as the ‘dog-whistle’ strategy) reached its peak in the lead-up to the 2004 campaign.</p>

<p>Here, too, the Assemblies of God featured prominently. While Adelaide’s Paradise Church was the launching pad for FFP, its Sydney counterpart, Hillsong, became associated with the Liberal Party. Not only did John Howard, his Liberal deputy Peter Costello and other senior Liberals address the church, but Hillsong has claimed Liberal Member for Mitchell Alan Cadman, Young Liberals president Alex Hawke and former NSW Liberal Party director Scott Morrison as members.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nick Bryant notes that Morrison was mentored by Brian Houston himself, which is where he <a href="http://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2012/february/1328593883/nick-bryant/so-who-bloody-hell-are-you">bases his ethical foundation</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Morrison is now a Pentecostal and thus part of the most rapidly growing denomination in the land. He worships at an American-style mega-church called Shirelive in his constituency, where the gospel of prosperity is preached in an auditorium that can accommodate over 1000 evangelicals. With its water baptisms and designer-shirt pastors, Shirelive has close ties with the better-known Hillsong community. The founder of Hillsong, Harley Davidson–riding pastor Brian Houston, is one of Morrison’s mentors. In Who’s Who Morrison lists the church as his number one hobby, and his maiden speech reads in part like a personal testimony delivered on the last night of a church retreat. It included passages from Jeremiah and also the Book of Joel: “Your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions.”</p>

<p>A test of his faith came during the period when he and his wife were trying to start a family. It involved repeated courses of IVF treatment and “14 years of bitter disappointments”, but Scott and Jenny were buoyed by their sense of the providential. “God remembered her faithfulness,” recalled Morrison during his maiden speech, as he paid tribute to his wife, “and blessed us with our miracle child, Abbey Rose.” The couple now have two daughters.</p>

<p>While his faith animates his politics, he is on the record as saying “the Bible is not a policy handbook, and I get very worried when people try to treat it like one”. Critics would say that is self-evident from his heartless response to asylum seekers. “I wonder how you can claim to be a serious Christian and take these positions,” said one former colleague. Supporters, however, claim he has pursued a faith-based policy. “He’s a very ethical and moral man,” says a fellow Liberal. “Stopping the boats is ethical and moral.” In his response to December’s boat people tragedy off Java, he advocated a ‘tough love’ policy, which he claimed had the safety of boat people at its heart. After all, for Morrison the Pacific Solution was not only efficient but righteous since it crushed the evil of people smuggling. Church friends might even have seen shades of Wilberforce in his efforts to eradicate such a nefarious trade. To his critics, however, his attacks on the government, which resumed 48 hours after the overloaded boat capsized, offered yet more proof of his harrying opportunism: this was more about political point-scoring than finding a workable solution.</p></blockquote>

</a>
<div class="video-info" >Thanks to http://www.crocosauruscove.com in Darwin, Australia. You&#8217;re able to feed, handle, and swim with crocodiles. This is part of the feeding using a fishing rod. Quite a unique experience. - As you can see they jump pretty high out the water. I didn&#8217;t know they could actually jump completely out of water.

Filming these animals in slow motion is just beautiful. Something you rarely see.

On a technical side of things.

This was all filmed using a Sony fs700 with a 18-200mm 3.5-5f lens. Shot at 480 frames a second. I borrowed the camera from Sony in Hong Kong to test, and  honestly I love it so much. You can capture such amazing detail in slow motion. If you&#8217;re going to shoot slow motion it&#8217;s the cheapest camera for an indie cinematographer. 

I wasn&#8217;t paid to say any of this, Sony just wanted some footage. Maybe I&#8217;ll buy the camera soon.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jessica Ainscough is working though a list of patsies, finding her way
into being reported (with the barest of skepticism) by the <a href="http://www.donotlink.com/dd9">Sydney Morning Herald</a>. I wrote about her
unfortunate dependance on quackery in
<a href="/blog/2013/06/24/coffee-enema/">June</a>, and her <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2013/10/17/sharyn-ainscough-dies-tragically-because-she-followed-the-example-of-her-daughter-the-wellness-warrior/">mother has since passed away</a>.
Orac notes that as Ainscough’s mother was dying, she claimed that the
tumours were “healing reactions” and there was an underlying “copper
toxicity” supposedly treatable with chelation therapy:</p>

<blockquote><p>How many times have we heard cancer quacks say this, that the cancer
is not the problem but rather a “symptom” of the “real” problem or a
“protective reaction” to the real problem?</p></blockquote>

<p>As I noted in June, Ainscough invented “psychic pollution”</p>

<blockquote><p>our negative thoughts also contribute to pollution on our planet. This
is called ‘psychic pollution.’ This fact has been proven: what we
think and feel has a direct impact on the world around us</p></blockquote>

<p>There are many benefits to encouraging cancer patients to seek
professional counselling services when dealing with the side effects of
radiation and chemotherapy, as well as depression resulting from their
diagnosis. Unfortunately, many quacks try to adopt the language of
pop-psychology and tell people with terminal cancer that their
depression is the <em>cause</em> of their terminal condition, and they need to
force themselves to think positively in order to be cured. Not only will
terminal patients go to the grabe believing that they have some
spiritual or mental deficiency that causes their condition, but quacks
are given an easy excuse for the failures of treatments on patients
believed to be too “weak” or “faithless”.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Following the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords, a large number of left
leaning media outlets criticised the right wing media’s hype and
extremism. Dan Lyons took <a href="http://www.fakesteve.net/2011/01/my-talk-with-a-left-wing-hack.html">them to task</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The problem began when news became tied to profits. The networks at
one time used to run news as a loss leader, subsidized by
entertainment. When that changed, and news started chasing ratings
(and dollars), the problem began. When dollars started to dry up,
things only got worse. Networks became desperate and resorted to
making the news more like entertainment.</p>

<p>The Internet made things worse, in two ways. First, the Internet
exacerbated the decline in revenues, and heightened the desperation in
the news business. Trust me, I’m in a position to know, because I’m in
the business of seeing just how far I can make news people bend in
order to keep getting my advertising dollars. That influence is
stronger now than it has ever been. The TV networks and magazines and
newspapers are desperate and terrified. Stuff that 10 years ago they
would have thrown back in our face they now do willingly — in fact,
they don’t even wait for us to suggest it. They suggest it themselves.</p>

<p>But second, and more important, the Internet created an outlet for
competing and often crazy voices. It gave birth to a new kind of
“news.” Despite what the new-media pundits claim, the much-celebrated
“citizen journalism” was all too often just noisy crap and propaganda.</p></blockquote>

<p>Most of the news is written by interns that only get hired if they drive
enough clicks to their linkbait articles:</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s garbage precisely because online news sites are not primarily
created to report news. They’re created to make money. Problem is,
it’s nearly impossible to make money doing what they do. So they
resort to ever more desperate tricks.</p>

<p>Why is so much online “news” reported in slideshow format? To gin up
clicks. Not because it is a better way to consume news, because,
please. Why is HuffPo so crowded with sensationalistic tabloid junk
about celebrity boobs and fluffy “lists” of “the deadliest ice
creams.” (And just about everyone else, too. )</p></blockquote>

<p>Ryan Holiday gave a keynote at TNW about how bad glorified blog
journalism is, and how easy it is to exploit media into running
“controversial” linkbait stories, like Sasha Grey in an American Apparel
ad campaign.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was going to write a post on Ivy League universities backing Massive
Open Online Courses though edX and other providers, and started thinking
back to the discussion of the OLPC project in 2007. Widespread media
coverage showed Kofi Annan holding a prototype laptop with a hand crank
and repeated the claim that the device would eventually be available for
$100. The hand crank and the $100 price tag were unachievable, and major
glitches in the first version of the laptops dampened the hype
surrounding the project.</p>

<p>Vaclav Smil, professor emeritus of environment and geography at the
University of Manitoba commented on the media’s tendency to see technology as a <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/11/vaclav-smil-wired/">magic solution to intractable problems</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>So the answers are not technological but political: better economic
policies, better education, better trade policies.</strong></p>

<p>Right. Today, as you know, everything is “innovation.” We have
problems, and people are looking for fairy-tale solutions—innovation
like manna from heaven falling on the Israelites and saving them from
the desert. It’s like, “Let’s not reform the education system, the tax
system. Let’s not improve our dysfunctional government. Just wait for
this innovation manna from a little group of people in Silicon Valley,
preferably of Indian origin.”</p>

<p>You people at WIRED—you’re the guilty ones! You support these people,
you write about them, you elevate them onto the cover! You really
messed it up. I tell you, you pushed this on the American public,
right? And people believe it now.</p></blockquote>

<p>Smil notes that the idea of efficiency gains in every sector is “Moore’s
curse”</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>You call this Moore’s curse—the idea that if we’re innovative
enough, everything can have yearly efficiency gains.</strong></p>

<p>It’s a categorical mistake. You just cannot increase the efficiency of
power plants like that. You have your combustion machines—the best one
in the lab now is about 40 percent efficient. In the field they’re
about 15 or 20 percent efficient. Well, you can’t quintuple it,
because that would be 100 percent efficient. Impossible, right? There
are limits. It’s not a microchip.</p>

<p>The same thing is true in agriculture. You cannot increase the
efficiency of photosynthesis. We improve the performance of farms by
irrigating them and fertilizing them to provide all these nutrients.
But we cannot keep on doubling the yield every two years. Moore’s law
doesn’t apply to plants.</p></blockquote>

<p>Benjamin Bratton made similar talks in a <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/30/we-need-to-talk-about-ted">TEDx talk about technological utopianism overlooking the difficult problems in philosophy and economics</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The key rhetorical device for TED talks is a combination of epiphany
and personal testimony (an “epiphimony” if you like ) through which
the speaker shares a personal journey of insight and realisation, its
triumphs and tribulations.</p>

<p>What is it that the TED audience hopes to get from this? A vicarious
insight, a fleeting moment of wonder, an inkling that maybe it’s all
going to work out after all? A spiritual buzz?</p>

<p>I’m sorry but this fails to meet the challenges that we are supposedly
here to confront. These are complicated and difficult and are not
given to tidy just-so solutions. They don’t care about anyone’s
experience of optimism. Given the stakes, making our best and
brightest waste their time – and the audience’s time – dancing like
infomercial hosts is too high a price. It is cynical.</p>

<p>Also, it just doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Recently there was a bit of a dust up when TEDGlobal sent out a note
to TEDx organisers asking them not to not book speakers whose work
spans the paranormal, the conspiratorial, new age “quantum
neuroenergy”, etc: what is called woo. Instead of these placebos, TEDx
should instead curate talks that are imaginative but grounded in
reality. In fairness, they took some heat, so their gesture should be
acknowledged. A lot of people take TED very seriously, and might lend
credence to specious ideas if stamped with TED credentials. “No” to
placebo science and medicine.</p>

<p>But … the corollaries of placebo science and placebo medicine are
placebo politics and placebo innovation. On this point, TED has a long
way to go.</p>

<p>Perhaps the pinnacle of placebo politics and innovation was featured
at TEDx San Diego in 2011. You’re familiar I assume with Kony2012, the
social media campaign to stop war crimes in central Africa? So what
happened here? Evangelical surfer bro goes to help kids in Africa. He
makes a campy video explaining genocide to the cast of Glee. The world
finds his public epiphany to be shallow to the point of self-delusion.
The complex geopolitics of central Africa are left undisturbed. Kony’s
still there. The end.</p>

<p>You see, when inspiration becomes manipulation, inspiration becomes
obfuscation. If you are not cynical you should be sceptical. You
should be as sceptical of placebo politics as you are placebo
medicine.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A new map by the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/interactives/GH_Vaccine_Map/#map">Council on Foreign Relations</a> shows
the rising number of vaccine preventable diseases in first world
contries. After Andrew Wakefield took out a <a href="http://briandeer.com/wakefield/vaccine-patent.htm">patent on a single Measels vaccine</a> he falsified a study that appeared to show that appeared to show that the Measels, Mumps and Rubella triple antigen was unsafe for children, proposing his own patented vaccine as a “safer” alternative. Even after Wakefield’s paper has been retracted for innacuracy, and he was struck off the medical register for <a href="http://briandeer.com/mmr-lancet.htm">“dishonest”, “unethical” and “callous”</a> behaviour, anti-vaccine hysteria continues to spread thoughout the world. The drop in MMR vaccination rates in Wales to below 80% has caused a widespread measels outbreak, leaving parents of infected teenagers feeling betrayed by the lies of the anti-vaccine movement:</p>

A recent measles fatality is likely linked to the Andrew Wakefield MMR fraud which led to a baseless reduction in uptake of the MMR vaccine. It&#8217;s apparent that now fear of the demonstrable harm of measles outweighs the fallacious fear of MMR.

<p>Australian ABC Lateline programme looks at the early-2013 outbreak of
measles in Wales UK. A recent measles fatality is likely linked to the
Andrew Wakefield MMR fraud which led to a baseless reduction in uptake
of the MMR vaccine. It’s apparent that now fear of the demonstrable harm
of measles outweighs the fallacious fear of MMR. Notifications equal 800
since November 2012 - approximately 7 times that for the entire year of
2012. The vast majority of parents now accept that the “callous” and
deregistered Wakefield is a charlatan and a fraud.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Wakefield is only the latest in a long line of cranks
opposed to the vaccination of children. I recently came across a talk by <a href="http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and-events/from-jenner-to-wakefield-the-long-shadow-of-the-anti-vaccination-movement">Professor Gareth Williams</a>
on the history of the anti-vaccine movement, going right back to Jenner
himself. Some doctors opposed cowpox vaccination as smallpox cases were
a large portion of their business, but most interestingly many people found religious arguments against vaccination. Theologians in France and England argued that ”<a href="http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/whitem10.html">diseases are sent by Providence for the punishment of sin</a>” and suggested that
Job’s <a href="https://net.bible.org/#!bible/Job+2:4">boils and ulcers</a> were a
result of cowpox vaccination by Satan. One of the most wacko opponents of the Jennerian society wrote that smallpox helped to <a href="http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/6059511?n=32&amp;imagesize=1200&amp;jp2Res=.25&amp;printThumbnails=no">lower the size of poor families</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>why is it not remembered that in the populous parts of the Metropolis,
where the abundance of children exceed the means of providing food,
and raiment for them, this pestilential disease is considered as a
merciful provision on the part of Providence, to lessen the burthen of
a poor man’s family ?</p></blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, while most doctors (Wakefield excluded) would never seek
to harm their patients to increase their own business, many pastors
coninue to teach that children should not be vaccinated against
infectious diseases. Measels outbreaks have been observed in areas with
low vaccination rates, commonly correlated with <a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/butterfliesandwheels/2013/09/vaccines-undermine-divine-providence/">high numbers of evangelical megachurches</a>.  Unfortunately, a number of churches order their congregation to eschew medical treatment in favour of prayer, which <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/01/17/idaho-republican-opposes-law-aimed-at-stopping-faith-healing-child-deaths/">Republican lawmakers protect as “religious freedom”</a>, even after a spate of preventable deaths.</p>

In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)</div>

<p>A few great points
* Inverting William Gibson&#8217;s view: &#8220;The future is here, and it <strong>is</strong> widely distributed&#8221;
* There is a global shift in power from the West to the East, and from traditional centralised power structures to users.
* The ability to see different perspectives over the same medium challenges the idea of a single source of truth.
* The freedom of the users comes directly from the freedom of the tools they use.
* Technologists have the abilitiy to route around a damaged system, but they have a moral responsibility to represent those that can&#8217;t.
* Internet users are among only a third of the world, and so every internet user has the power to effect the world in positive ways.
* Pia on Hipsters: Billie Brag quote &#8220;Cynicism is the perfect enemy of progress.&#8221;
* If we don&#8217;t work to shape the future, someone else is going to shape it for us.
* The future is not just being determned in traditional ways.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There’s a great article in the New York Times about how politicians and

It links to a great graph from boingboing pointing out the fallacy of
<a href="http://boingboing.net/2013/01/01/correlation-between-autism-dia.html">confusing corellation with causation</a>:</p>

<p>Science Magazine is one of the bastions of reason, with Nobel lauriets
signing an open letter denouncing the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6152/1320.full">destruction of test
crops</a></p>

<blockquote><p>New technologies often evoke rumors of hazard. These generally fade
with time when, as in this case, no real hazards emerge. But the
anti-GMO fever still burns brightly, fanned by electronic gossip and
well-organized fear-mongering that profits some individuals and
organizations. We, and the thousands of other scientists who have
signed the statement of protest, stand together in staunch opposition
to the violent destruction of required tests on valuable advances such
as Golden Rice that have the potential to save millions of
impoverished fellow humans from needless suffering and death.</p></blockquote>
