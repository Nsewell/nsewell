<p>http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/when-faith-and-sexuality-collide-20130413-2hskc.html#
&#8220;I know of a church where one of the pastors recommended to a guy that he go and see a female prostitute because he couldn&#8217;t comprehend that this guy could not be attracted to or enjoy sex with a woman&#8221;</p>

<p>Chambers
http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/2010/03/04/20825“the majority of people that I have met, and I would say the majority meaning 99.9% of them, have not experienced a change in their orientation or have gotten to a place where they could say that they could never be tempted or are not tempted in some way or experience some level of same-sex attraction.”</p>

<p>In advance of the Exodus Freedom Conference in Irvine, California, and of
the airing of Lisa Ling’s <em>Our America</em> tomorrow night, in which he is
confronted by “ex-gay” survivors, Alan Chambers <a href="http://exodusinternational.org/2013/06/i-am-sorry/">has issued a long
apology</a> to the
LGBTQ community on Exodus’s website. While much more work obviously
remains to be done to make sure that Exodus is truly serious about never
again destroying the lives and families of LGBTQ people in the name of
faith, the apology is striking in that there is little to no
equivocation. I’m going to excerpt most of it, bolding parts that I feel
important, and we will have more commentary on this in the coming days:</p>

<blockquote><p>Recently, I have begun thinking again about how to apologize to the
people that have been hurt by Exodus International through an
experience or by a message. I have heard many firsthand stories from
people called ex-gay survivors. Stories of people who went to Exodus
affiliated ministries or ministers for help only to experience more
trauma. I have heard stories of shame, sexual misconduct, and false
hope. In every case that has been brought to my attention, there has
been swift action resulting in the removal of these leaders and/or
their organizations. But rarely was there an apology or a public
acknowledgement by me.</p>

<p>And then there is the trauma that I have caused. <strong>There were several
years that I conveniently omitted my ongoing same-sex attractions.</strong> I
was afraid to share them as readily and easily as I do today. They
brought me tremendous shame and I hid them in the hopes they would go
away. <strong>Looking back, it seems so odd that I thought I could do
something to make them stop. Today, however, I accept these feelings
as parts of my life that will likely always be there.</strong> The days of
feeling shame over being human in that way are long over, and I feel
free simply accepting myself as my wife and family does. As my friends
do. As God does.</p>

<p>Never in a million years would I intentionally hurt another person.
<strong>Yet, here I sit having hurt so many by failing to acknowledge the
pain some affiliated with Exodus International caused, and by failing
to share the whole truth about my own story. My good intentions matter
very little and fail to diminish the pain and hurt others have
experienced on my watch.</strong> The good that we have done at Exodus is
overshadowed by all of this.</p>

<p>Friends and critics alike have said it’s not enough to simply change
our message or website. I agree. I cannot simply move on and pretend
that I have always been the friend that I long to be today. <strong>I
understand why I am distrusted and why Exodus is hated.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Please know that I am deeply sorry. I am sorry for the pain and hurt
many of you have experienced. I am sorry that some of you spent years
working through the shame and guilt you felt when your attractions
didn’t change. I am sorry we promoted sexual orientation change
efforts and reparative theories about sexual orientation that
stigmatized parents. I am sorry that there were times I didn’t stand
up to people publicly “on my side” who called you names like
sodomite—or worse. I am sorry that I, knowing some of you so well,
failed to share publicly that the gay and lesbian people I know were
every bit as capable of being amazing parents as the straight people
that I know. I am sorry that when I celebrated a person coming to
Christ and surrendering their sexuality to Him that I callously
celebrated the end of relationships that broke your heart. I am sorry
that I have communicated that you and your families are less than me
and mine.</strong></p>

<p>More than anything, I am sorry that so many have interpreted this
religious rejection by Christians as God’s rejection. I am profoundly
sorry that many have walked away from their faith and that some have
chosen to end their lives. For the rest of my life I will proclaim
nothing but the whole truth of the Gospel, one of grace, mercy and
open invitation to all to enter into an inseverable relationship with
almighty God.</p>

<p>I cannot apologize for my deeply held biblical beliefs about the
boundaries I see in scripture surrounding sex, but I will exercise my
beliefs with great care and respect for those who do not share them. I
cannot apologize for my beliefs about marriage. <strong>But I do not have
any desire to fight you on your beliefs or the rights that you seek.
My beliefs about these things will never again interfere with God’s
command to love my neighbor as I love myself.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You have never been my enemy. I am very sorry that I have been
yours.</strong> I hope the changes in my own life, as well as the ones we
announce tonight regarding Exodus International, will bring
resolution, and show that I am serious in both my regret and my offer
of friendship. I pledge that future endeavors will be focused on peace
and common good.</p>

<p>Moving forward, we will serve in our pluralistic culture by hosting
thoughtful and safe conversations about gender and sexuality, while
partnering with others to reduce fear, inspire hope, and cultivate
human flourishing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Words are words, but words matter in that they are a start. We anxiously
await the announcements regarding Exodus’s future that Alan mentioned,
and we hope that Exodus’s “future” is that there won’t be one. That
would seem to be the only surefire way to stop the bleeding.</p>

<p>Lisa Ling’s special on Exodus airs tomorrow night at 10 EDT on the OWN
network.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A team of Harvard psychologists recently completed a study showing a correlation between religious belief and performance on the well-known Cognitive Reflection Test The CRT goes like this; consider these simple maths quesions:</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total.  The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball.  How much does the ball cost?</li>
<li>If it takes five machines five minutes to make five widgets, how long does it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?</li>
<li>In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads.  Every day, the patch doubles in size.  If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>You may have confidence in your answers. The answers are below these optical illusions, that show how you interpret the world may be mistaken:</p>

<p><img src="/images/illusion-Zollner.png" alt="Zollner Illusion" /></p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%B6llner_illusion">Zöllner illusion</a> demonstrates that while lines actually run in parallel, they look wonky when a pattern makes you believe that they aren&#8217;t straight.</p>

<p><img src="/images/illusion-pisa789.jpg" alt="Double Leaning Tower of Pisa Illusion" /></p>

<p>Both of these images are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaning_tower_illusion">exactly the same</a>. Try covering one of them with your hand. When you see both images along side each other, your mind automatically assumes that the one on the right must come from a different angle.</p>

<p><strong>Answers</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>You would expect the ball to cost $0.10 if the bat cost $1.00, but the bat costs $1.00 <em>more</em> than the ball, giving the correct answer of <strong>$0.05</strong></li>
<li>While the intuitive answer is 100 minutes, it takes five machines five minutes to produce one widget each, so it takes 100 machines five minutes to produce one widget each (100 widgets).</li>
<li>The intuitive answer is half the days (24), the correct answer is 47 (because the patch doubles each day).</li>
</ol>


<p>These aren&#8217;t difficult questions, but many people get the answers wrong when they don&#8217;t think the problem though methodically, relying on intuition instead of slow, methodical, rational thought. More religious people <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matthew-hutson/what-kind-of-thinker-beli_b_2759701.html">tend to get more of the answers wrong</a>, trusting their intuition more than less religious participants.</p>

<p>David Hume said &#8220;reason is the slave of the passions&#8221; and modern neuroscience backs the claim up.
Daniel Kahneman has noted differences in the way that people <a href="http://edge.org/conversation/the-marvels-and-flaws-of-intuitive-thinking">process information quickly and intuitively, compared to how they think slowly and methodically</a>.</p>

<p>Very often we can fail to spot things that we&#8217;re not looking out for. Today <em>Scientific American</em> published an article on selective attention, where people can fail to notice the things &#8221;<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=your-hidden-censor-what-your-mind-will-not-let-you-see&amp;page=1">your mind will not let you see</a>.&#8221; In one study white women were asked to concentrate on a ball-tossing video, then asked if they noticed a black man or a white man in the middle. One group primed on a task aimed at finding a &#8220;a suitable neighbor or co-worker&#8221; were equally likely to see both men. Another group primed on looking for a friend or date noticed the white man more than twice as often as the black man.</p>

<p>Many societies that have multicultural workplaces don&#8217;t have as many mixed ethnicity marriages, meaning that many people may be more subconsiously accustomed to seeing people of other races in a distant setting but not as accustomed to them being friends or family. In several studies where participants <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/108/13/E46.full">were given a shot of oxytocin</a>, the participants showed increased trust and co-operation with their in-group, while maintaining the same level of trust with their out-group. In <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/108/4/1262.full">one study</a>, participants performed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_Association_Test">implicit association test</a>, where participants are timed in their categorisation of images of faces by grouping them with words that have positive or negative emotions. We often perceive visual information quickly, while rationally processing it takes longer. The Scientific American article mentions a similar study:</p>

<blockquote><p>On some trials of their experiment, one eye saw a neutral picture like a lamp, and the other eye saw a bloody scene of violence. On other trials, one eye saw a neutral picture and the other saw an erotic nude picture. The subjects’ conscious experiences of the pictures flipped back and forth, but the scenes of sex and violence were more likely to be the first ones seen, and they occupied consciousness much longer than the boring neutral images. Several studies have now confirmed that dangerous things like snakes, angry men, and snarling dogs can break through our concentration and intrude on consciousness. Dirty words and naughty pictures have the same effects&#8230; If it gets your heart racing it will get your attention.</p></blockquote>

<p>Make sure you don&#8217;t get distracted when considering the beautiful dolphins on this bottle:</p>

<p><img src="/images/dolphinsex.jpg" alt="Dolphin Illusion" /></p>

<p>In a hunter-gatherer context, humans would need to interrupt their slow thinking processes to quickly react to a predator that suddenly appears, leaving us with sex and violence being distracting and intensely engaging in ways that reflective modes of thought aren&#8217;t. Why else would there be so much sex and violence on HBO shows like <em>Game of Thrones</em>?</p>

<p>The article goes on with this clincher:</p>

<blockquote><p>There is something particularly disquieting about this brand of bias, because there is a power asymmetry. The unconscious screener shapes what the conscious “you” gets to see, but the conscious “you” doesn’t have veto power over that decision. Of course, you could try to shift your attention or change your goals once you are aware of them, but by then it may be too late. The unconscious always has a head start.</p></blockquote>

<p>Jonathan Haidt likens fast and slow thinking to an <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/the-mind-has-an-elephant-of-its-own/2006/07/25/1153816179991.html?page=fullpage">emotional elephant with a rational rider</a>. The rider likes to think that he is in control, but really, the much larger elephant has most of the say in what direction the pair takes. In <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/files/emotional_dog_and_rational_tail.pdf">The Emotional Dog and its Rational Tail</a> Haidt states &#8220;moral reasoning is usually a post-hoc construction, generated after a judgment has been reached.&#8221; We assume that we are in control of our decisions, and yet psychology and behavioral economics shows that most of our rational decisions are a &#8220;slave&#8221; to the snap emotional judgements we make.</p>

<p>Consider Eddie McGuire&#8217;s <a href="http://theconversation.com/racism-in-the-afl-eddie-mcguire-and-the-media-prove-theres-still-a-long-way-to-go-14838">likening of Adam Goodes to King Kong</a> after nearly a week of condemning racially villifying remarks about Aboriginal AFL players. This doesn&#8217;t just highlight Eddie McGuire&#8217;s stupidity but points to the wider problem of people allowing racial stereotypes to colour their sentiments of people, while denying to themselves and others that any bias exists. Even people sincerely opposed to racism can act in <a href="http://theconversation.com/are-you-racist-you-may-be-without-even-knowing-it-10826">ways that express biases without knowing it</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Here’s an example of how this kind of thing can occur, from a <a href="http://socialjudgments.com/docs/Uhlmann%20and%20Cohen%202005.pdf">2005 American study</a>.
In this study, participants were asked to choose the better applicant
for the job of police chief. There were two candidates. One was “street
wise” while the other had more formal education. One was male, one was
female. Some experimental subjects were given the choice between a male
street wise applicant and a female formally educated applicant, while
some got the options reversed, with the female applicant being the
street wise one.</p>

<p>Here’s the interesting finding – both groups tended to pick the male
applicant as the better qualified. They justified this choice by
reference to the qualification the female lacked&#8230;</p>

<p>It looked as though they were making a judgement based on what qualifications they thought were required for police chief. They weren’t really: they were making a judgement based on gender, and justifying it, based on a confabulated theory about what qualifications were required for police chief.</p></blockquote>

<p>Similarly, when right of centre voters criticise Gillard in an excessively personal way (&#8220;Ju-liar&#8221;), a confabulatory process may mask mysoginistic attitudes as a justified criticism of her character and agenda. Worse, a tribal grouping of people who agree with each other&#8217;s politics encourages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_cognition">cultural cognition</a>, with their own biases being confirmed by mostly talking with people who agree. Worse still is when they believe that their group is <a href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Sherif/chap7.htm">pitted against other groups, rather than a part of a political system that has the whole country&#8217;s interests at heart</a>. This will mean going beyong the current 24 hour news cycle driven vituperative personality politics and trying to find bipartisan unity in policy based discourse.</p>

<p>Many figures like Haidt <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_how_common_threats_can_make_common_political_ground.html">want the media to stop feeding into a cycle of partisanship on critical issues</a> like US spending on prison systems, which has liberals denouncing the incaceration rates of ethnic minorities, conservatives concerned at <a href="http://www.rightoncrime.com/the-conservative-case-for-reform/what-conservatives-are-saying/">prisons expenditure risking the bankruptcy of several US states</a> and both concerned at <a href="/blog/2013/01/03/rentier-theology/">bribery of the judiciary to raise sentences to increase demand for prison builders</a>.</p>

<p>If smart people can become more aware of their own biases, then they may be more likely to see the things that their subconsious may otherwise ignore, like successful people from racial minorities (or moonwalking bears). Then racism and sexism won&#8217;t be as much of a concern.</p>

<p>Online media has the potential to diversify the sources of information that people receive, as well as the potential to propagate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP4A6SbRdzM&amp;t=4m37s">extreme crank theories</a>. My belief is that if enough people are able to have a committment to consider the evidence rather than interpret facts though their own filter, then the good will outweigh the bad and most people will benefit from a rational discussion on important issues.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From <a href="http://www.stufffundieslike.com/2013/06/a-dress-code">Stuff Fundies Like</a>, the Victory Faith Bible KJV1611 Baptist Church Dress Code for Ladies’ (sic). Yes, there are a huge number of typo&#8217;s (couldn&#8217;t refuse). As the old quote attributed to <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Miriam_A._Ferguson">Miriam A. Ferguson</a> goes, &#8220;If the King&#8217;s English was good enough for Jesus Christ, it&#8217;s good enough for the children of Texas!&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><h4>That which pertaineth to a man</h4>

<p>Ladies’ must abstain from all appearance of evil. That means our ladies’ here at VFBKJV1611 Baptist Church should not where pants or shorts.</p></blockquote>

<p>When your church&#8217;s abbreviated name is a mouthfull, you know the commitee that designed it did a good job listening to every one of the paritioners&#8217;.</p>

<blockquote><h4>Tops</h4>

<p>Blouses and dresses must reach the colorbone and be buttoned all the way up. If the buttons gap open at the bust, ladies’ should go up a size or use safety pins to avoid having their <strong>braziers</strong> showing, which can be very tempting to our young men and therefore inappropriate. Blouses should be full and not darted, which means there should be no ungodly emphasis on the waistline or underbust. Arms should be no shorter than the elbow. Sheer materials should be avoidable, but if you must wear a sheer blouse, also wear a <strong>skin-collared brazier</strong> and a full slip to conceal <strong>you’re nakedness</strong>. Tee shirts, tank tops and other immodest tops are not acceptable.</p></blockquote>

<p>I need to add a new favourite Christian pick up line &#8220;Your brazier gets my brazier going.&#8221; A great one to slip in after &#8220;nice bible&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;ve been reading Numbers and I realised I don&#8217;t have yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>By way of explanation: Bra is short for Brassiere, pronounced &#8220;/brəˈzɪər/&#8221; in the US, leading to word completion suggesting &#8220;brazier.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><h4>Skirts</h4>

<p>Skirts should be at least 3 inches below the knee so that you can sit, kneel and otherwise move around without expositing your knee. Your skirt should also be at least a-line and preferably circle or very full to avoid drawring unnecessary attention to your legs. The waist should hit at your natural waist (low waistts are not acceptable) and be gathered to avoid unnecessary attention to the hips. Your skirt should have no slits. Kick pleats should not be necessary if your skirt is properly full. All <strong>ladies’ should where a slip</strong> with their skirts to avoid immodest exposure that could lead to lustful thoughts.</p></blockquote>

<p>Girls, why stop at the knee length skirts? Why not go to a <a href="http://thefbomb.org/2009/11/corduroy-skirts-are-a-sin/">full length corduroy skirt</a>?</p>

<p><img src="/images/corduroy.jpg" alt="Corduroy Skirts are a Sin" /></p>

<blockquote><h4>Culottes</h4>

<p>Box pleat culottes are required for outdoors activities, but <strong>we ask that our ladies’ not where them to services</strong>. Culottes should follow the same rules as skirts and reach at least 3 inches below the knee and be sufficiently full that <strong>we do not see the shape of your legs</strong>. Also, if you canot do it modestly in culottes, you should rethink doing it at all. It may just <strong>not be a ladylike actvitiy</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>And if your daughter starts looking too butch, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyKw4yKfWOU">tell her off</a></p>

<blockquote><h4>Legs</h4>

<p>We know you have them. We do not want to see them. Please wear nylons or tights to conceal the flesh of your legs. Closed-toed shows are not mandatory, but we do ask our ladies’ to consider the fleshly desires of our gentlemen and dress accordingly. Heels that excessively “bunch up” the calf are nightclub attire, not church attire. Bobby socks and canvas tennis shoes are acceptable for certain functions. Please ask Mrs. Pastor for more information.</p></blockquote>

<p>And so the ladies&#8217; all know that the other ladies&#8217; have legs, which the men never, ever see.</p>

<blockquote><h4>Hair</h4>

<p>The KJV1611 says long hair is a glory. We request that our ladies’ <strong>discuss their hair with their husbands or fathers</strong> to determine the most appropriate hair length for godly glory. Hair should be a natural color (no red, pink or blue, please!) and cut in a flattering, modest manner that does not bring undue attention to our godly ladies heads.</p></blockquote>

<p>What the hell is a woman&#8217;s father doing giving you fashion advice? What would a man know about hair other than &#8220;I&#8217;m sure it looks <strong><em>fine</em></strong>.&#8221; At least they&#8217;re not asking <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2012/06/27/the-ugly-side-of-modesty/">grandpa for advice</a>.</p>

<blockquote><h4>Makeup and jewelry</h4>

<p>Ladies, if the barn needs painting, paint it, but <strong>avoid whoriehs excessiveness</strong>. Lipstick should be natural-colored, and leave the false eyelashes at home! Jewelry should be limited to (one) wedding ring and (one) engagement rink. GOD Himself tells us that peircings are a sign of slaves, not godly women, so skip them!</p></blockquote>

<p>Most any modern Christian would interpret biblical references to slavery as part of a bygone era. <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2013/03/doug-wilsons-race-problem.html">Not so in the wonky world of parochial Southern Christianity</a></p>

<blockquote><h4>Bodies</h4>

<p>We understand that ladies come in all shapes and sizes. That said, ladies who are thin should consider the effect of their vanity on their soles. Ladies who are bigger need to <strong>worry about their husbands’ soles and maybe lose some weight</strong> so their husbands are not tempted to stray. The rest of you ladies need to wear looser-fitting clothes to conceal your hips and other lady areas. We recommend jumpers since these offer the best coverage of (we apologize for our course language) curves.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yeah your husband&#8217;s shoes will wear out if he insists on <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2013/03/15/christian-pastor-i-carry-my-wife-around-the-house-every-day-to-show-her-whos-boss/">carrying you around the house to show you who&#8217;s boss</a></p>

<blockquote><h4>Other</h4>

<p>Any other concerns not already mentioned can be discussed with our godly pastor or any of the deacons, who would be happy to set up a private appointment to discuss your modesty needs or <strong>evaluate a particular outfit</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Something tells me most of these evaluations are not initated by the women themselves.</p>

<blockquote><h4>Visitors</h4>

<p>We understand that nonmebers may arrive wearing inappropriate clothing. Although we are always happy to welcome new people, we do feel it is important to emphasize modesty to protect our men from lustful thoughts. If you notice a visitor lady who is wearing a tight skirt, pants or a low-cut blouse, please let her know we love her as a sister, and <strong>offer her one of our spare sweaters</strong> (they are located in the church foyer’s coat rack) to wear over her top or place over her bottom half while she is sitting.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, because nothing will make a young woman in normal, socially acceptable knee length shorts feel comfortable than being told she has to put a borrowed sweater over her legs in a condescending &#8220;we just want the best for you&#8221; manner.</p>

<blockquote><p>We appreciate all our sisters’ in Christ taking the time to keep our church modest! Let us know if there is any way we can support you in this endeavor. </p>

<p>Please sign and date this document to signify your agreement to the dress code.</p></blockquote>

<p>The best part is many right wing Independent Fundamentalist Baptist churches support the <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/English-only_movement">English Only movement</a> and are opposed to immigration reform.

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Answering Creation Ministries&#8217;s Questions</h3>

<p>Creation Ministries International run a &#8220;Question Evolution&#8221; campaign, handing out a pamphlet that asks 15 supposedly &#8220;unanswerable&#8221; questions about evolution. This article by <a href="http://www.morganstorey.com/">Morgan Storey</a>, seeks to answer all their questions, with references to find more information. You will have to do some research on your own, that is what science is about: doing the leg work to find out for yourself, nothing is handed to you on a silver platter or in a pretty leather bound book.</p>

<h3>15 questions for &#8220;Evolutionists&#8221; answered.</h3>

<p>Firstly we are not evolutionists; there are people who accept evolution and those that reject it. It would be like saying <a href="http://www.philvaz.com/apologetics/p67.htm">gravityists</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease">germists</a>.</p>

<h3>1. How did life originate?</h3>

<p>A good question to be sure, but not actually an answer for the theory of evolution. As answering how the stars accreted isn&#8217;t an answer for the theory of gravity.</p>

<p>But to answer this, the current field that studies this is a field somewhere between chemistry and biology called abiogenesis. It studies how biological chemicals can form in different environments. Famous experiments such as the Miller-Urey experiment have shown that biological chemicals can form. More recent experiments of this nature have shown more complex biological chemicals forming such as proteins and long chain acid molecules similar to the precursor to DNA, RNA.</p>

<p>There is no definitive answer for how life originated on earth, it is very difficult for this kind of life to have survived till now for us to study it and primitive life would more than likely have not left fossils and even if they did due to subduction these fossils would no longer be accessible, or may have been destroyed by as the earth they were embedded in subducted back into the magma of the mantle.</p>

<h3>2. How did the DNA code originate?</h3>

<p>Again not the area of evolution. Evolution works via Natural selection on existing life, or even on the precursor which is not considered alive RNA. It is likely that DNA originated from RNA as DNA is simply a more stable double-helix over RNA&#8217;s single. But we don&#8217;t know, RNA/DNA is not fossilized as it decays too quickly, and it is unlikely that any primitive DNA/RNA transition will be found. There have been recent experiments that have shown XNA an even more stable triple-helix that never evolved on earth from the life we have today. The reason is very interesting. Although <a href="http://io9.com/5903221/meet-xna-the-first-synthetic-dna-that-evolves-like-the-real-thing">XNA</a> is less prone to copying errors and mutations it would also take a lot longer to evolve in changes, so it sacrifices its ability to change for stability. Obviously the balance was struck with DNA or XNA simply never formed.</p>

<p>Long answer short, we don&#8217;t know. That doesn&#8217;t mean it can&#8217;t be one of our simply answers rather than adding a complexity of a designer.</p>

<p>See also: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeno_nucleic_acid">Xeno Nucleic Acid</a>.</p>

<h3>3. How could mutations-accidental copying mistakes create the huge volumes of information in the DNA of living things?</h3>

<p>This is a little misleading, DNA isn&#8217;t a code. It is a strand of molecules; it is only given a code so that we humans can understand it. It is translated by other chemical reactions in the cells that they occupy. But the mutations caused during life and passed on as well as the copying mistakes can add information. As any computer scientists knows if you copy multiple files in the wrong way you can combine them together going from 2 files to one much larger one. This has happened in biological DNA, human’s ancestors the old world apes have one more pair of chromosomes over humans, this was not understood for a long time and then it was found. The ends of chromosomes have these things called telomeres that stop the copying process when a strand is being duplicated; they mark the end of the strand. These have been found in the middle of a pair of human chromosomes, bearing the same markers as two pair in our nearest cousins the chimps. The chromosome pair at some stage fused too form one instead of two. Giving more DNA to the single chromosome and allowing for natural selection to work on a bigger selection of traits.</p>

<p>Not all traits from mutations are negative. There have been people found who have a <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/10/4/l_104_05.html">mutation that makes them immune to the HIV virus</a>, others in a <a href="http://phys.org/news101624600.html">small town in Italy that metabolise cholesterol so well that they never have a heart attack from their cholesterol rich diets</a>.</p>

<p>Others such as <a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2007/apr/the-upside-of-color-blindness/">colour blindness</a> and schizophrenia are being investigated for advantages regardless of the negatives, e.g. colour blind individuals can pick out camouflaged animals where others can&#8217;t.</p>

<h3>4. Why is natural selection taught as if it explains the origins and diversity of life?</h3>

<p>It does explain the origin of our lives and the diversity of life we see around us. There is evidence in many species of its evolution; we have fossil evolutionary evidence for horses, wales, and of course humans. If you have a better hypothesis that explains all the current evidence and doesn&#8217;t add any extra complicated variables then propose it and it will be tested by other scientists, they will either find evidence for it, or none. If evidence cannot be found then it is un-falsifiable and simply bad science.</p>

<h3>5. How did the biochemical pathways, which involve multiple enzymes working together in sequence originate?</h3>

<p>You go from very simply worded questions to one like this, which seems like you want to throw people off your scent. But regardless, you are describing irreducible complexity inside cells. Which is something that is being actively studied, however evolution has had billions of years to build all of this up we have had only a couple hundred years. So we don&#8217;t know exactly, some of these enzymes and proteins may have evolved simultaneously from earlier simpler proteins and enzymes, in earlier and more primitive cells. This is what we see in extremophiles, but more study is required. Would you abandon your faith if it were discovered how these proteins and enzymes evolved, if not then you can&#8217;t use this argument.</p>

<p>References: <a href="http://www.sciencecodex.com/u_of_minn_researchers_unveil_first_artificial_enzyme_created_by_evolution_in_a_test_tube-105949">Researchers unveil first artificial enzyme created by evolution in a test tube</a></p>

<h3>6. Living things look like they were designed, how do evolutionists know they were not designed?</h3>

<p>Ok so things I guess could look designed&#8230; by a very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_poor_design">bad designer</a>. The heart in a human has too few arteries to supply it with enough blood for it be as efficient as it should be for a land animal; it is fine for marine animals. Similar for the placement of spine along the back for an upright walker and the lack of extra sets of teeth for an animal such as us that lives so long, not to mention the laryngeal nerve that I am sure you have heard of, that runs from brain to voice box to allow all animals to control its muscles, except it makes a detour below the heart which is a lot longer than needed for humans, but think about the poor Giraffes where the detour is 18feet.</p>

<p>The universe is really not designed for us, most of it is deadly to us, too close to a star, neutron star, black hole, or galactic core and you will die, the blackness of space at a whopping 2.7Kelvin or -270.45 degrees Celsius (-454.81F) not to mention trillions of wandering asteroids and planets the size of Jupiter ready to wipe us out.</p>

<p>But even if all these design flaws didn&#8217;t exist then so what, it looks designed. Maybe we design things that look like nature because we are a part of it; we can&#8217;t design anything to not look like nature as we have no experience with things that aren&#8217;t part of nature.</p>

<h3>7. How did multi-cellular life originate?</h3>

<p>This is pretty simple. This is like saying how did humans and other animals work out that living and working together in packs, heards or tribes increased our chances for survival. We already see bacterial colonies that are colonies of lots of individual cells of bacteria working and living together, why not pool resources and specialise some bacteria to take in food and others to expel waste?</p>

<h3>8. How did sex originate?</h3>

<p>Interestingly we don&#8217;t know exactly. Again this <a href="http://talkorigins.org/indexcc/CB/CB350.html">probably originated early on in life’s development</a>, as some forms of bacteria don&#8217;t procreate asexually, some procreate with DNA from another party, some are not just binary male and female, but multi-sexed, having up to 7 different sexes, all of which need to come together to make an offspring. But larger than bacterially we are pretty much limited to the binary male and female. Though some switch such as certain fish and amphibians and for example the whip tail lizard and some lie along the gender path such as humans who can be born with both male and female genitalia, although a lot of these are non-functional there have been instances of functioning intersex humans.</p>

<p>The point is binary sexuality is a myth that has been perpetuated due to its prevalence not its truth. Many animals <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2013/04/accessible-res-snail-sex.html">can reproduce sexually and asexually</a>. Different genders of more than one do show better diversity and thus higher likelihood of passing on successful mutations such as the aforementioned HIV and cholesterol advantages. But obviously higher than two can be difficult to organise for the animals affected so it wasn&#8217;t as successful.</p>

<h3>9. Why are the expected countless millions of transitional fossils missing?</h3>

<p>This is a double whammy misconception; Every fossil ever found is a link between older and newer forms, so every fossil is a <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Transitional_fossils">transitional fossil</a>, your bones according to evolutionary theory are a transitional fossil of your father to your child. If you don&#8217;t have kids then you are an evolutionary dead end. It happens with surnames as it happened with our ancestors such as homo neanderthalis (to some extent, they did interbreed with us a little too).</p>

<p>Many transitional forms have been found that closed parts of the fossil record that were previously accused of having &#8220;gaps&#8221;.<br/>
In fact, in the century-and-a-half since then, we’ve found millions of
evolutionary intermediaries in the fossil record, much more than Darwin
said he could reasonably hope for. The transitional fossils that have
been found (such as <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Tiktaalik" title="Tiktaalik">Tiktaalik</a>,
<a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Ichthyostega" title="Ichthyostega">Ichthyostega</a>,
<a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Australopithecus" title="Australopithecus">Australopithecus</a>, <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Homo_habilis" title="Homo habilis">Homo
habilis</a>,
<a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Archaeopteryx" title="Archaeopteryx">Archaeopteryx</a>,
the <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Microraptor" title="Microraptor">Microraptor</a> and so on) provide clear evidence of transitions, in this case from water to
land and from land to flight. There are three different types of
transitional forms and we have ample examples of each. But creationists
still insist that we’ve never found a single one, because what they
usually ask us to present are impossible parodies which evolution would
neither produce nor permit (such as the
<a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Crocoduck" title="Crocoduck">Crocoduck</a>).</p>

<p>Evolution doesn&#8217;t dictate we would find fossils at all, that is geology. Fossilization is a very rare process so the fact we have any fossils at all is amazing. The missing fossils you talk of may always be missing, it doesn&#8217;t discredit the theory, it just means we realise our limitations of finding fossils at other records such as genetic evidence.</p>

<p>You say all the missing links are imagined, but that is just plain wrong you can go to your local natural history museum and see replicas of the skulls and sometimes entire skeletons of our ancestors. We have found hundreds of examples of some of these ancestors and the documentation and photographic evidence is in biological textbooks, physical evidence is available at some of the luckier natural history museums and research facilities. As like other fossils they are rare and expensive.</p>

<h3>10. How do &#8220;living Fossils&#8221; remain unchanged over supposed hundreds of millions of years if evolution has changed worms into humans in the same time frame?</h3>

<p>In the same time frame it turned the same worms into lions and elephants and whales and fish. These &#8221;<a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Living_fossil">living fossils</a>&#8221; are called that as at least their initial outward appearance appears not to have changed, but new evidence suggests they have. Science changes it views based on what is observed, it is not afraid to admit it is wrong. The most famous &#8220;living fossil&#8221; the coelacanths is a fish that has found a very good niche so has had little selective pressure to change greatly from it hundred million year old ancestor, but it has changed according to recent research. Incidentally genetically its common ancestor with earth worms is the same as humans 782.7 million years ago roughly. So this and other &#8220;living fossils&#8221; simply have found a niche and a stable spot in the food change where any mutation that is beneficial to a changed environment will not help them so it doesn&#8217;t bread true.</p>

<h3>11. How did blind chemistry create mind/intelligence, meaning, altruism and morality?</h3>

<p>Blind chemistry didn&#8217;t. Chemistry was probably the start of the precursor to life, but after that natural selection and evolution took over. It evolved in varying traits that where advantageous, such as communally living bacteria, then communally living animals such as schools of fish, then fish that where more cunning may have survived to pass on their DNA and been selected for, and intelligence built. This is why things like octopus can remember how to open jars as they can remember how to hide in certain types of coral and open certain types of shells to get to the tasty molluscs inside.</p>

<p>Morality and altruism is the realm of evolutionary psychologists, a relatively new field that has proposed various methods to answer how these features of our intelligence are advantageous in a community such as the ones humans and other animals form. The same reason piranha do not attack each other during a frenzy is the same reason we will assist our neighbour.</p>

<p>Life is not meaningless; it has whatever meaning you deign to it. If you give your life meaning through charity and altruism then society deems you a good person, if you give it through theft and crime society will punish you through the secular law system. The legal system has been built up by people not wanting others to treat them in such a manner, similar to the Christian golden rule but modified to allow for outliers such as those that may enjoy giving or receiving pain. The better version of the golden rule is &#8220;Do unto others as they would have you do unto them&#8221;.</p>

<p>So although some parts of morality and altruism are evolved others are learnt and passed down from parent to child. There are tribes that believe it is perfectly fine to kill unruly children and that anyone over 30 is not a member of the tribe. This does lead to a kind of moral relativism, but most ethicists will agree that what is moral is what causes the least amount of harm, and not caring for your young or elderly does cause harm to them, whereas caring for them causes in most circumstances almost no harm.</p>

<p>Morals are relative; it is not ok to kill&#8230; unless the person you are killing is threatening you or a loved one’s life. It is not ok to steal&#8230; unless if you don&#8217;t you or a loved one will die. It is not ok to lie&#8230; unless if you do so others will be harmed as I am sure a German harbouring Jews in WW2 would have realised.</p>

<h3>12. Why is this evolutionary &#8220;just-so&#8221; story telling tolerated?</h3>

<p>This is really a loaded question, these aren&#8217;t just-so stories they are different stories that describe the entirety of our species. Kind of like the 3 blind-men describing an elephant, one grabs the trunk and describes it is a powerful type of snake, another feels the leg and describes a tree, another feels the feathery tale and describes a bird, all are wrong by themselves, but together their picture is of an elephant.</p>

<p>The stories talked about here are just-so as there is a huge pool of humans that these DNA sequences play out. Even in recorded history there were millions of us on the planet, this diversity is what has made us strong as a species. Some of us have blue eyes and thus better vision during the night and overcast winters, others have brown eyes with better vision during the day, this diversity and communal living means we are more likely to survive as a species as a single disease can&#8217;t come through a wipe us out, and different people can have different specialties.</p>

<h3>13. Where are the scientific breakthroughs due to evolution?</h3>

<p>The quote used here is what is called quote mining; Dr Kirschner is actually complaining here that there is little interdisciplinary work with other biologists. Biologists need a grounding in evolution to truly understand and model every experiment they perform.</p>

<p>Norman Borlaug in 1970 was awarded the Nobel Prize for his use of evolutionary theory to create crops that have so far saved possibly billions of lives.</p>

<p>Every year the flu shot that is given out is due to the use of evolutionary theory to determine how influenza strains will change in the coming year, the same is done for new strains of existing vaccinated diseases.</p>

<h3>14. Science involves experimenting to figure out how things work; how they operate. Why is evolution, a theory about HISTORY, taught as if it is the same as OPERATIONAL science?</h3>

<p>Firstly I don&#8217;t think theory means what you think it means. In science when you pluck an idea out of the air you have a hypothesis, not a theory. When your hypothesis is able to fail a test as in it is falsifiable and you have a lot of evidence backing a hypothesis and you have had your hypothesis tested by others and then you get it test a fair few more times, then and only then can you call it a theory. Looking at the numbers for example for the recently failed faster than light Tau Neutrino hypothesis they did 50,000 tests of their hypothesis before they released a paper for others to attempt to replicate or fail the experiment. They were quickly dismissed as the result couldn&#8217;t be replicated and they re-checked and re-checked their equipment and found the flaw&#8230; literally a loose wire.</p>

<p>Evolution via natural selection has been tested millions of times; errors have been found and corrected. The theory has changed, you may say due to this selective pressure it has evolved.

<h3>15. Why is a fundamentally religious idea, a dogmatic belief system that fails to explain the evidence, taught in science classes?</h3>

<p>Sorry but I think I have shown how it explains the evidence, Darwin’s original hypothesis is testable and falsifiable, if no change where found in species, if a rabbit was found in strata of the pre-Cambrian it would be false and we would have to go back to the drawing board. If no way to transmit changes down from mother to child where discovered then it would be false, remembering that genes where not discovered till well after Darwin’s death, he was vindicated there.</p>

<p>Besides it is science, science isn&#8217;t about the comfortable or reassuring it is about what is true, even though evolution may not be comforting or reassuring to your beliefs it has shown to be true so far. If a better hypothesis comes along that explains the facts better, is tried tested and wins in the battle between scientific ideas then it will be the latest answer. But all evidence points to that not being much off what evolution via natural selection currently is.</p>

<p>I think teaching creation &#8220;theory&#8221; in a science class is the same as teaching the aforementioned phrenology in a neurology class, or teaching the stalk theory of birth in a sex-ed class, it is ludicrous and damaging to our children’s future. I know our kids are bright, they can take the idea of evolution and marvel and the grandeur and luck they have to just be here out of the literally billions upon billions of other DNA combinations that could have happened in their place.</p>

<p>Who is responsible for this pamphlet?
Sydney atheists care of www.sydneyatheists.org have used the design as a commentary on the original under fair use and thus they are responsible.</p>

<p>Although we are atheists, we care about what is true. We would prefer you believed the truth about our origins and believed in a god or gods than believe a falsity such as creation and also believe in God. Literal bible belief carries with it baggage no one wants, and will only lead to fundamentalism of a scale that will lead to war and violence.</p>

<p>Steven Pinker in an <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/why-are-states-so-red-and-blue/">opinion piece</a> suggested that the reason America is so polically and socially diverse. He argues that Blue states were largely settled by English farmers, while Red states by Scots-Irish herders.</p>

<blockquote><p>Societies that herd livestock in rugged terrain tend to develop a “culture of honor.” Since their wealth has feet and can be stolen in an eye blink, they are forced to deter rustlers by cultivating a hair-trigger for violent retaliation against any trespass or insult that probes their resolve. Farmers can afford to be less belligerent because it is harder to steal their land out from under them, particularly in territories within the reach of law enforcement&#8230; Southerners today continue to manifest a culture of honor which legitimizes violent retaliation</p></blockquote>

<p>Pinker notes that under traditional, rugged societies violent and aggressive men were meant to be civilised by a churchgoing woman.</p>

<blockquote><p>Another cliché of the cowboy movies also had an element of historical truth. As more women moved west, they worked to end the lifestyle of brawling, boozing and whoring they found there, joining forces with the officials in charge of the rowdy settlements. They found a natural ally in the church, with its co-ed membership, norms of temperance and Sunday morning discipline.  By the time the government consolidated its control over the West&#8230; the norms of self-defense through masculine honor, and the restraint of ruffianism by women and church, had taken root.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many Southern Baptists continue with a frontier tradition of distrusting and resenting government (especially federal) laws that restrict personal freedoms, they readily believe that arbitrary and pointless church rules are good for them. It&#8217;s this type of political climate that breeds <a href="/blog/2013/01/03/rentier-theology/">strange bedfellows, with the Religious Right co-opting both religion and politics</a>.</p>

<p>According to a new study, reported in The Age, <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/health/worry-grows-over-safety-of-childhood-jabs-20130519-2juvt.html">53% of Australian parents have concerns about vaccinating their children</a>.</p>

<p>The NSW opposition is considering allowing childcare centres <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-19/push-to-ban-unvaccinated-children-from-nsw-preschools/4698786">ban unvaccinated individuals</a>. The opposition states that immunisation rates are lower than in Rwanda and Iran. Looking the stats up, it&#8217;s true. <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.IMM.MEAS/countries">WHO data on measels immunisation</a> show that 94% of Australian children are immunised, compared to 99% in Iran and 95% in Rwanda. <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.IMM.IDPT/countries">WHO data on Diptheria, Pertussis and Tetanus immunisation</a> shows 92% of Australian children are immunised, compared to 99% in Iran and 97% in Rwanda. <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/political-news/rwanda-trounces-australia-at-immunisation-20130529-2nc5n.html">Eritrea and Bangladesh also have higher immunisation rates</a></p>

<p>There were <a href="http://www0.health.nsw.gov.au/data/diseases/measles.asp">172 cases of measles in NSW in 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.wahs.nsw.gov.au/news/2012/20121004_00.html">requiring the opening of new health centres to distribute the Mesles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine</a>. Rubella is rare, with less than <a href="http://www0.health.nsw.gov.au/data/diseases/rubella.asp">6 new notifications</a> a month, Mumps spiked to <a href="http://www0.health.nsw.gov.au/data/diseases/mumps.asp">24 cases in June 2012</a>. Pertussis (Whooping Cough) has trended downwards from around 2,000 new cases being reported in January 2009 to <a href="http://www0.health.nsw.gov.au/data/diseases/pertussis.asp">less than 200 new cases a month in 2013</a>. Lack of concern about diseases like Whooping Cough may be a byproduct of good public health measures to prevent curtail the disease.</p>

<p>Data from Medicare show that NSW and WA have <a href="http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/provider/patients/acir/statistics.jsp">the lowest immunisation rates</a> with 89.3% of WA children 60-63 months of age. There are communities with less than <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-04-11/children-across-australia-not-fully-imunised/4622666">85% of children vaccinated, with 77,000 not fully immunised nationally</a>. Pockets in <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-03-20/anti-vaccination-campaigns-threaten-measles-free-status/4584514">northern NSW and southern QLD are at greatest risk</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Dr MacIntyre says some parts of Australia have a greater risk of a measles outbreak because of lower immunisation rates, such as northern New South Wales and southern Queensland.</p>

<p>Australian Medical Association (AMA) president Steve Hambleton says it is those areas which threaten Australia&#8217;s position.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our [measles] elimination status is under threat because there are pockets of decreasing immunisation of our children,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some affluent areas in Sydney also have <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-04-11/low-immunisation-rates-in-affluent-sydney/4622634">lower immunisation rates</a>
Unfortunately fear campaigns like Meryl Dorey&#8217;s Australian Vaccination Network have scared a small number (2%) of parents into rejecting vaccines, and a large proportion of parents feel a concern. Around 8% of parents don&#8217;t fully vaccinate their children, and would benefit from a public health campaign that listens to their concerns and tries to address them.</p>

<p>NSW Health minister Tanya Plibersek has launched a booklet &#8220;Immunisation Myths And Realities&#8221; and advised parents &#8221;<a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/dr-google-cant-be-trusted-with-childs-health/story-e6frg6n6-1226650596663">Dr Google has been a negative influence</a>&#8221;. My opinion is that NSW Health and the AMA should be more proactive in online media, taking out ads on search results for searches like &#8216;vaccination&#8217; to make sure that correct information comes up before the AVN&#8217;s fearmongering, as while &#8220;Dr Google&#8221; may be prone to misinformation, the reality is that more and more parents will turn to it.</p>

<p>In the past it was possible to tell parents &#8220;just trust your GP and do what they say&#8221;. It may be more helpful, in future, to ensure that GPs listen to their patients to maintain high levels of trust in the public health system in an era of consumer focussed medicine and online misinformation campaigns.</p>

Michelle Knight was kidnapped in 2002 aged 20, Gina DeJesus was 14 when she was kidnapped. Some of the women had childen by their captor, and Michelle Knight reportedly was forced to deliver them in unsanitary conditions, without any training. The women were rescued when a neighbor, who happened to have the day off, heard one of their screams and kicked down part of the door.</p>

<div class="youtube-lazy-link-info">Charles Ramsey interview, rescuer of Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight in Cleveland</div>
</a>
<div class="video-info" >CLEVELAND - After going missing more than 10 years ago, Amanda Berry shouted to a man from a Seymour Avenue house on Monday.
Charles Ramsey and Angel Cordero broke down the door and freed Berry, who was 16 when she disappeared in 2003. Cordero told NewsChannel5&#8217;s Stephanie Ramirez that he recognized Berry from posters and that she was with a 4 or 5-year-old child.

Other victims Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus.

</div>


<p>The neighbor, Charles Ramsey, had lived next door for a full year and ate together with the captor, with no idea what was happening inside the home. While the media says that he&#8217;s a hero, he insists that anyone else would have done the same thing in the circumstances. What has haunted him, however, was the knowledge that he could have intervened much earlier had he known.</p>

<p>One of the girls, Amanda Berry, had her face all over the news when she was kidnapped in 2003. Berry&#8217;s mother refused to give up hope of finding her daughter alive for 19 months, until she turned to a &#8220;psychic&#8221; who told her &#8221;<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/05/amanda_berry_is_dead_psychic_t.html">She’s not alive, honey</a>.&#8221; The poor woman died in 2006, never knowing that her daughter was alive.</p>

<p>On learning of her niece&#8217;s freedom, Georgina DeJesus&#8217;s aunt proclaimed that the rescue was a miracle, and &#8221;<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2013/05/08/cleveland-women-were-chained.html">God works in mysterious ways</a>&#8221;. One of the more disturbing revelations is that the rapist <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/may/08/cleveland-ariel-castro-child-abduction">was a school bus driver investigated by police in 2004 for abduction and endangering children</a> after he kept a boy on his school bus for two hours. Police officers turned up to the abductor&#8217;s home months before he kidnapped DeJesus, but left after nobody answered their knocks on the door. This is much like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping_of_Jaycee_Lee_Dugard#Missed_opportunities_to_rescue_Dugard">Jaycee Lee Dugard</a> case, where three years before the abducted girl was rescued, a neighbor informed the police there were tents in the abductor&#8217;s backyard with children living in them. Police talked with the abductor for 30 minutes on the property, but never searched it. After Dugard&#8217;s rescue, she was awarded a settlement of $20 million dollars from the Californian government for their mishandling of the case. Many people talk about the rescue of the girls being a miracle, and yet in both cases we see god failing to nudge the police in the right direction years before.</p>

<p>Consider this scenario: if you found a neighbor begging and pleading to escape the house, whould you intervene by kicking down the door straight away? Or if you would wait to let the captor free the girls of his own accord, how long would you wait for? Now consider: if you were God, would you intervene straight away if you heard a captive&#8217;s pleas? Would you choose to violate the captor&#8217;s free will in order to protect the women? If you would intervene straight away, why didn&#8217;t God intervene for Michelle Knight for over 12 years?</p>

<p>William Lane Craig defines God <a href="http://www.skepticink.com/reasonablyfaithless/2013/01/01/arguing-about-ontology/">in this way</a>: “God is, by definition, the greatest being conceivable.” Can you conceive of a God that doesn&#8217;t take 12 years to hear the cry of an abducted girl? Then it would seem that you can conceive of a greater being than the one Dr Craig believes in.</p>

<p>To me, the God of the Old Testament seems like a capricious and vindictive sort of character. Can you imagine a god that doesn&#8217;t endorse <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deut21.10-14&amp;version=NET">sex slavery for widows</a> or the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=num31&amp;version=NET">enslavement of 32,000 virgins for the enjoyment of Israelite soldiers as part of their &#8220;booty&#8221;</a>? What about a god that doesn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/may/30/christian-fundamentalists-plan-teach-genocide">order the slaughter of Amalekite men, women and children</a> (often taught as a <a href="https://intrinsicdignity.wordpress.com/2010/04/19/good-news-club-on-the-slaughter-of-the-amalekites/">lesson in <em>complete</em> obedience</a>)? If you can imagine a deity without any of these bloodthirsty traits then by Dr Craig&#8217;s logic you&#8217;ve disproven the Old Testament god is the one true God.</p>

<p>What if you don&#8217;t like Paul&#8217;s views on <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1pet2.18;tit2.9;eph6.5-8&amp;version=NET">slaves</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph5.22-24&amp;version=NET">women</a> or <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1ti1.8-10;1cor6.9-10;rom1.18-32&amp;version=NET">gays</a>? Simple, just start your own faith tradition to worship your own interpretation of the Christian god. There are between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian#Demographics">38,000</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_denominations">41,000 Christian denominations</a> in the world, more than the <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=number%20of%20sentences%20in%20the%20bible">33,829 sentences in the KJV</a>. Some of these denominations are the same movement in different countries, but the figures show Christians have a wide diversity of opinion not just on liturgy but on core beliefs like the inspiration of scripture, the divinity of Jesus, the existence of hell, the role (if any) of baptism and any methods of salvation.</p>

<p>Protestants maintain that the only thing necessary for belief is scripture alone (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_scriptura">Sola Scriptura</a>).
If Protestantism is true, and a key part of Protestant Christian experience is reading the bible, why
did it take so long to invent a printing press? Why didn&#8217;t Yahweh pop one in at the first council of Nicea in 325 CE when they established biblical cannon?</p>

<p>If Jesus was the incarnation of the Logos of a triune godhead, did he have omniscience to see the future? Could he see that <a href="http://www.errancywiki.com/index.php?title=Legends2">5 different endings to Mark would be added by five different scribes</a>? Why didn&#8217;t he give his disciples an approved, inerrant version of his teachings? If salvation from an eternal torment in conscious pain requires the accurate transmission of scripture, why didn&#8217;t God ensure that the scripture could be accurately copied and transmitted from the very start of the early Church? Couldn&#8217;t that have minimised the number of differences of opinion between denominations?</p>

<p>Even in an age when most Chrisitans do have 4-7 bibles in their home, most don&#8217;t read them. In one study, 10% of Americans thought that <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2007/0704.balmer.html">Noah&#8217;s wife was Joan of Arc, and two thirds thought Billy Graham preached the Sermon on the Mount</a>. Most people&#8217;s favourite &#8220;bible verse&#8221; was &#8220;God helps those who help themselves.&#8221; Less than half of Americans could name one of the gospels, and only a third could name all four. It&#8217;s this kind of ignorance that leads to one of the best known quotes of Jesus saying &#8220;the poor you will always have among you&#8221; being <a href="www.smh.com.au/opinion/bible-bashing-the-homeless-abbott-style-20100215-o2tj.html">used to oppose aid for the poor</a> despite the fact that Jesus said it in the house of <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt26.6-13;mark14.3-9&amp;version=NET">Simon the leper</a> while eating with <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jn12.1-8&amp;version=NET">Lazarus, who he raised from the dead</a>.</p>

<p>Ironically, in a time of rising illiteracy, we also see conservatives demanding belief in <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/exploringourmatrix/2012/06/ken-ham-wants-other-christians-to-be-con-artists-like-he-is.html">young earth creationism</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention_conservative_resurgence">inerrancy</a> of scripture (not infallability), bordering on &#8221;<a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/2012/03/guest-post-the-culture-of-biblical-inerrantism/">biblicalism</a>&#8221;.</p>

<p>If Jesus had omniscience, could he fortell of the <a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/god-science-and-black-death-plague.html">millions that would die in the Black Plague</a>? Could he fortell that it would take the scientific method centuries after the plague to understand how to stop the spread of disease? He decided to let people know that hell burns eternally at <a href="http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/hell.htm">the boiling point of Sulfur, 444.6 degrees Celcius</a>, but did he tell people how long to boil water for to sterilise surgical tools?</p>

<p>When Republican Senate candidate Richard Mourdock said pregnancy resulting from rape is something “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl9e-f6nbd4">God intended to happen</a>,” it lead many to ask the question; does that mean the rape is something God intended to happen? Medicine has established the germ theory of disease (still denied by Mary Bakker Eddy&#8217;s Christian Science cult) only from studying dead bodies. If it&#8217;s God&#8217;s will that modern medicine be able to treat sick people so that our Western life expectancies are many times what they were in the dark ages, did God preordain doctors to treat people? And if they needed cadavres to research, did God preordain that the knowledge would be gained from deaths?  If God has given us knowledge and the ability to use logic, why not give us the brains to innovate faster and prevent unnecessary deaths?</p>

<p>Consider how bad medical knowledge was throughout the dark ages. Carl Sagan writes in The Demon Haunted World:</p>

<blockquote><p>Pre-modern medical practice did not save many. Queen
Anne was the last Stuart monarch of Great Britain. In the last seventeen
years of the seventeenth century, she was pregnant eighteen times. Only five
children were born alive. Only one of them survived infancy. He died before

<p>If God could have providentially sent scientists at any point in human history, why wait over a millennium to give humans the germ theory of disease? Why wait until after Queen Anne&#8217;s demise to give humans knowledge of Obstetrics and Gynecology?</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t find myself able to believe that there is any God capable of influencing the world today. It seems more likely that humans have picked themselves up by their bootstraps, and while religion continues to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPDlgq-znrY&amp;list=PL9zmXhEAnxT9hXW_2NJ7ZvdbiMuwSN5Ll&amp;index=6">perpetuate violence and hostility in the third world</a> the West is <a href="http://thegatesnotes.com/Books/Personal/The-Better-Angels-of-Our-Nature">experiencing a period of unprecedented peace and prosperity</a>. In fact, it seems that for most of human history people have been <a href="http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/199704--.htm">expanding their circle of empathy</a> from themselves to their families, their churches, their nations and to collections of nations. The future of humanity will be brighter if we can expand this circle to all humans and even other animals and the environment:</p>

<p>I believe that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFDJJ1KydgE">promoting human flourishing and the minimisation of suffering rather than any ideology</a> will have the biggest positive impact on humankind. In fact, the pursuit of ideologies can often get in the way of human good. Consider the case of a 22-year-old Salvadoran woman with Lupus having to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/el-salvador-must-provide-pregnant-woman-access-life-saving-medical-treatment-2013-04-17">seek approval to abort her brainless foetus from the Salvadoran Supreme Court</a>, after all abortions were banned in 1998. Despite the fact that the foetus will never be conscious, or able to feel pain, Catholic Bishops are campaigning not to let the woman terminate the pregnancy that threatens her life. In my opinion, this is the dangerous product of basing decisions on ideology, not facts.</p>

<p>As a humanist, I believe that the promotion of human welfare should trump ideology, and this is enough to have a worthwhile purpose in life. Robert Green Ingersoll <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Robert_G._Ingersoll">stated it like this</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Reason, observation and experience have taught us that happiness is the only good; that the time to be happy is now, the place to be happy is here and the way to be happy is to make others so. This is enough for us. In this belief we are content to live and die.</p></blockquote>

<p>Already as I write this some people will be asking where they went wrong. Was it that they didn&#8217;t share enough <a href="http://www.ship-of-fools.com/gadgets/food_drink/015.html">testamints</a> or didn&#8217;t buy me the <a href="http://wp.patheos.com/blogs/unreasonablefaith/files/2009/07/armor-of-god-pjs.jpg">Full Armor of God Pyjamas</a> or was it that I acquired critical thinking skills and wrestled with these and other questions? Probably the pyjamas. Of course, Chrsitianity has taught me many <a href="http://christiannymphos.org/2009/07/09/cunnilingus-101/">useful things</a> and I still enjoy reading Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes. I am truly happy that while some sermons have verged on putting me to sleep, no preacher has ever <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVCQbVcnCwA">punched me in the face</a> or insisted that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQSmtNbraGU">I save my kiss until marriage</a>.</p>

<p>Some fundamentalist churches teach to love your neighbor, but hate Hindus, Buddhists, atheists, Muslims, gays, Jews, blacks and anyone suspected of being a feminist. This might make sense in a small street in a leafy suburb, but does it work if you live in an apartment? What happens when your digital neighbours are not just the 10 people you know on your street but the 600 people you know on social media? You&#8217;re going to hear the attitude and opinions of people with differing political, religious and ideological views. And really, when Jesus restated Leviticus 19:34 with the command to love your neighbor as yourself, he did not say love your male neighbor, or love your white neighbor, or love your straight neighbor, or love your beliving neighbor. Don&#8217;t do this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/unicorn-shun.jpg" alt="Shuun the non-believer!" /></p>

<p>I am happy to publicly state my opinion and I believe that everybody who wants to should be able to question every belief that I hold, attack every doctrine that I maintain and answer every question that I pose. But there&#8217;s a time and a place for this. Until then, why not just be friends?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The religious right has been using sex to sell a represive anti-sex agenda, creating the idea of soulgasms, where if Jesus is in the room, couples will have the most amazing orgasms ever, so long as they are married.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;We must fight [lust] with the massive promise of superior happiness. We must swallow up the little flicker of lust’s pleasure in the conflagration of holy satisfaction.” John Piper</p></blockquote>

<p>Many Christians today don&#8217;t present Jesus as a redeemer for all people and all cultures that saves individuals into a community that will have a transformative influence on their life. Instead they present a moralising gospel of American Jesus as the functional saviour that will give someone friends, social status in the Christian subculture, and perfect sex in a perfect marriage so long as they look and sound Christian enough. Rather than empowering countercultural belief in liberation theology of Jesus&#8217;s teachings, it imposes a literalistic rule based adherance to a culture of shame, fear and intimidation of Christendom. It&#8217;s against this context that mission strategies are devised to present Christianity as the solution to singleness, rejection and loneliness.</p>

<p>This has many damaging effects on young people inculcated into the culture. It tells young adults that virginity matters more than chastity, and even if they spend 60 hours a week volunteering for charity, they have no standing in the church if they have ever had sex. It forces young women into the position of having no sexual agency, no ability to consent to sex, but all of the responsibility for &#8220;causing&#8221; lust in men.</p>

<p>Barna has polled the reasons why young adults leave the church (and many leave the faith altogether). Their <a href="http://www.barna.org/teens-next-gen-articles/528-six-reasons-young-christians-leave-church">results show six key categories for why people leave</a>, facts that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karl-giberson-phd/creationists-and-young-christians_b_1096839.html">cause consternation for some</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Churches seem overprotective.</li>
<li>Teens and 20-somethings&#8217; experience of Christianity is shallow.</li>
<li>Churches come across as antagonistic to science.</li>
<li><strong>Young Christians&#8217; church experiences related to sexuality are often simplistic, judgmental.</strong></li>
<li>They wrestle with the exclusive nature of Christianity.</li>
<li>The church feels unfriendly to those who doubt.</li>
</ol>


<p>Presenting sex inside marriage as always perfect, always effortless and always satisfying as it is in accordance with &#8220;God&#8217;s design&#8221; sets young couples up for a steep learning curve. Those who can&#8217;t wait, like <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1802108/">95% of Americans</a> or <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3156853/">70% of conservative Texan Southern Baptist couples</a> will feel secret shame that they may not even be able to bring before a pastor if they have overstated the significance of sex in relation to other sin. The flipside of this involves pushing abstinence-before-marriage sex education, that misrepresents the risks of unprotected sex in order to suggest that marrital sex is the only &#8220;safe&#8221; form. Studies have found that factual distortions of abstinence-until-marriage campaigns around the benefits of condom use lead teenagers who sign abstinence pledges <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2768056/">to be just as sexual, but less likely to use condoms</a>.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a stranger niche of homeschooled daughters going to purity balls, to leart to save their first kiss until their wedding day. These girls learn all kinds of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQSmtNbraGU">creepy ideas about how they need to date their fathers in order to marry the perfect man</a>. Having taken the simplistic black and white answers around sex, they are now pushing out a legalistic agenda to beyond what the bible even remotely supports.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s starting to be pushback.</p>

<h3>DRISCOLL</h3>

<p>On December 21, 1999 George Barna&#8217;s Christian polling firm announced the results of their study on religion and divorce. The uncomfortable reality was that &#8220;born again&#8221; Christians were <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020616112707/www.barna.org/cgi-bin/PagePressRelease.asp?PressReleaseID=39&amp;Reference=B">significantly more likely to get divorced than atheists and agnostics to get divorced</a> (27% versus 21%). This strongly challenged the naive assumption that &#8220;couples that pray together stay together&#8221; that had been previously unquestioned in White evangelical churches. Significant time and money was spent investing in couples&#8217;s counseling and therapy, and new ranges of &#8220;sexual fulfilment&#8221; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYVicYHNrAA">seminars, books and courses</a>. Pastors started running &#8220;Bed-in&#8221; competitions, getting married couples to <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/sermons-sex-pastors-preach-pro-sex-god-christian/story?id=15433285#.UaD4v0FR8t8">publicly admit that they enjoy having sex</a>. &#8220;Marriage strengthening&#8221; and couple counselling became a focus of many churches, so much so that some pastors started titillating their engaged couples and singles with racy sermons from Song of Songs. Entrepreneurs set up stores with &#8221;<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18975616">Christian sex toys</a>&#8221; after the market exploded when normal women suddenly found approval for &#8220;marital aids&#8221;.</p>

<p>Mark Driscoll made his career out of packing young people into his churches to hear his sexed up sermons. It&#8217;s a fast way to get <a href="http://nytimes.com/2009/01/11/magazine/11punk-t.html?pagewanted=2">youtube fame after being kicked off God.tv</a> as young people all over the world seek a style of religion that is less suffocating and more understanding of issues being faced by Millenial couples. This started to go off the rails, however, when Driscoll resorted to <a href="https://freedom4captives.wordpress.com/2009/06/21/35-driscoll-your-husbands-appreciate-oral-sex-so-serve-them-well/">proof-texting individual verses of Song of Songs to command women to perform specific sex acts they did not want to</a>. Despite the fact that Proverbs states that the way of a young man with a maid is <a href="http://bibleapps.com/proverbs/30-19.htm">too wonderful to know of</a>, metaphoric portions of a Hebrew love song written more than 2,000 years ago were being forced into a very modern, over-sexed American culture. Demanding a pastor (who&#8217;s not qualified as a sex therapist) to give couples a literal yes and no answer to every sexual question they may have is never a good idea, and often it means imposing the pastor&#8217;s limited, sexist understanding onto other couples.</p>

<p>Driscoll is facing an increasing amount of pushback as people see his personally sexist views pervading his biblical interpretation. Driscoll&#8217;s wife grace interpreted the biblical queen Vashti as being killed for <a href="http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/esther-and-vashti">not being submissive to her husband&#8217;s commands that she prance around naked in front of his drunk guests</a>. More and more people are recognising that Driscoll&#8217;s ideas about marriage are more of a <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2011/12/24/grace-and-mark-driscoll-write-a-how-not-to-book-on-marriage/">how not to guide</a>.</p>

<h3>Damage</h3>

<p>Pushing damage onto women
http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com.au/2012/04/whores-meditation-on-gender-and-bible.html</p>

<p>Ezekiel 23</p>

<p>Ignorance of the size and extent of the purity culture leaves people unable to understand its real effects. Shaming female sexuality can cause <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2011/11/the-purity-culture-and-sexual-dysfunction.html">serious sexual dysfunction well into marriage</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>After a few months, I did start having sexual fantasies. But they were all fantasies of non-consensual sex. Why? Because on some intuitive level that made them safer, less taboo, and less sinful. After all, in these fantasies, I didn’t have a choice. I didn’t have sexual agency. I wasn’t choosing to have sex. I wasn’t active. It wasn’t that I wanted to fantasize about non-consensual sex; rather, as a result of the purity culture and my suppression of my sexuality, this was the only kind of sex I could fantasize about.</p>

<p>When my husband and I began having sex, we found that the only way I could orgasm was to pretend our sex was non-consensual. It was as though imagining and miming being coerced was the only way I could truly let go, detach from myself, and give myself permission to feel sexual pleasure. Being an active sexual agent, even in my thoughts, had been a no-no for so long that this suppression had become hard-wired into my brain. It literally took us years to figure out a way for me to have orgasms without pretending that our sex was non-consensual. I have nothing against people who simply enjoy this sort of sex play or this sort of fantasies, and I’m not saying it’s bad. It’s just that I really wanted to be able to experience orgasm without having to pretend sex was non-consensual.</p>

<p>It’s been some years now, and things have gotten better. I can have orgasms without pretending our sex is non-consensual, and I now have sexual fantasies in which I am an active sexual agent. There are some things I’m still working on, because these sorts of thought patterns don’t go away overnight, but I’m confident that I’m on the right path and have a bright sexual future.</p>

<p>How did this happen to me? It’s simple, really. I spent the first twenty years of my life suppressing every sexual urge, thought, or desire. I literally became essentially asexual. Literally. My sexuality was dead, because I had killed it. I had sacrificed it on the alter of the purity culture in a desire to make myself pure and godly. And yet, I’d always been taught that once I was married I would experience carefree, romping, ecstatic, incredible sex the likes of which I could not imagine. There is a disconnect here. How is one supposed to go from being sexually suppressed and extinguished to being an active and fulfilled sexual being?</p>

<p>I was taught growing up that every sexual thought or desire outside of marriage is sin. Believing this, I spent twenty years working hard to keep from thinking about sex, and I succeeded. I was essentially asexual. And then, with my husband, I was suddenly supposed to think about sex. My mind rebelled. My indoctrination of my own brain had been all too successful. My sexual dysfunction was only natural.</p></blockquote>

http://www.cnbc.com/id/100522472</p>

<blockquote><p>… Schuller Wyatt was scheduled to appear on the Hour of Power broadcast where her brother Robert “Bobby” Schuller III preaches. But when word got out that Schuller Wyatt had written God and Boobs, she was unceremoniously dumped via email from a church executive who gave no explanation.</p>

<p>“I’m tired of religious bullies dictating to women how we should live our lives. In my work as a pastor, I counseled too many women who felt ashamed of their sexuality and were silenced into submission. I am trying to empower them to feel good about themselves.“</p>

<p>Spiritual leaders have been guilty of teaching women to hide their figures in dumpy clothes, to avoid thinking about sex and to ignore their sexual desires. Whether Protestant or Catholic, most religious rules about sex result in women feeling their sexuality is shameful. Women in my religious circle won’t typically admit to their friends or pastors that they’ve felt this way, but they will tell their counselors. In the privacy of a safe setting, they talk of things like having to endure looks from their pastor that made them feel dirty. Making matters worse is the rampant hypocrisy in religion. The same leaders who set strict boundaries on sexuality are often exposed for exploiting sex in their private lives. When their sins come to light, they’re revealed as consumers of pornography, prostitution and illegal sex-enhancing drugs. Certainly, not all spiritual leaders are guilty of this kind of hypocrisy, but it is prevalent enough to cast a shadow on the world’s prominent religions.
The devout Christian women I know tend to heed their leaders’ advice. Every piece of clothing is viewed through the lens of lust. Will this shirt show too much cleavage? Is my hemline too short? Am I going to cause a man to sin? They end up thinking about their cleavage as much as the men around them do.
I once heard a pastor chide women in his church for wearing tops that were cut too low. If the congregation wasn’t thinking about breasts walking into the building, they were certainly thinking about them as they walked out. I heard nothing else the pastor said that day. I kept thinking to myself: How low it too low? Who is the appointed Cleavage Monitor? Who draws the line between sinner and saint?
Years ago, my brother told me that if a man is going to lust, he’s going to lust. You could put a girl in a potato sack and he’d still become aroused. It’s our own conscience that must resolve the questions of sexual expression and attire.</p>

<p>Enhanced by breasts, hips and figures that curve, a woman’s body is shaped by God. It’s a beautiful piece of art, meant to be alluring and sensual in all the right places. But religious women feel insecure about their curves to the point of layering on their clothes until they’ve covered every inch of their femininity.</p>

<p>This point was driven home by a friend, who told me about a film crew from a local news organization that was reporting on a major Christian women’s conference in her city. She knew about the situation because she worked at the conference behind the scenes. The crew was trying to wrap the shoot, but they couldn’t seem to get the footage they wanted. The hold-up? They needed an interview and couldn’t find a single woman, she was told, who looked like a cute, normal girl and not “a bag lady.”</p>

<p>Are women meant to live this way? Is this what God requires of us? Does God want us to feel shame about our sexuality? Women deserve a shame-free existence. They should explore, adore and adorn their shapes. There’s nothing shameful about a womanly figure that evokes sexual feelings, because women, like men, were designed to have sex. It’s natural. There are ways to embrace our figures, without putting them on display, to celebrate them and keep them sacred.</p></blockquote>

<p>Still others like Dianne Anderson are speaking out on the damaging nature of denying women sexual agency
http://diannaeanderson.net/?p=1288
When Chrisitans discuss sex,</p>

<blockquote><p>Consent doesn’t enter into the picture, because if enthusiastic, positive consent is discussed, it might end up teaching people that healthy sexual relationships can and do happen outside of a marriage relationship. And then all hell breaks loose!</p></blockquote>

<p>http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/christians-idolize-virginity</p>

<p>http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2013/02/christian-bloggers-pushing-back-on-virginity.html</p>

<p>Dan Fincke of Cammels with Hammers points out that many <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2011/02/sex-and-apostasy/">parents who themselves lived a life of moderate libertinism are happy to have their children inculcated into a doctrine of asceticism they could never follow</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>When it is actually beneficial in practice for people to reject fundamentalist Christian restrictiveness about sex, they leave the church.  When they are married and raising children, suddenly they endorse a system of values that conveniently allows that only married people can have sex and that their teenage and young adult children cannot.</p>

<p>Religious people of this sort are some of the worst and most blithe and uncondemned species of hypocrites out there.  They condemn the same healthy process of normal sexual development they personally benefited from while considering themselves especially devout and moral people for “repenting” of their ways when all they did was get married and find the church suddenly extremely convenient to their sexual goals of monogamy and their desire that their teenage and young adult children remain chaste.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just came across one of the most condescending, self righteous and judgemental Christian tracts to shame young people about their lives I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>

<p><img class="center Satisfied, Teen Ager" src="/images/teenager1.jpg">
<img class="center Satisfied, Teen Ager" src="/images/teenager2.jpg"></p>

<blockquote><p>Within you there is an emptiness - a vacuum. You&#8217;ve tried to find satisfaction. Drinking, smoking, petting, indulging in shameful sex acts has not filled that void. Yet, you seek for greater thrills, you cultivate a deeper love for the pleasures of this world. You&#8217;ve tried to convince yourself that you are happy, but <em>HELL</em> rages within.</p>

<p><em>SOON!</em> you will stand before the almighty God on the judgment day and give an account of every dirty joke, curse word, evil action and neglected opportunity of being saved from all sin.</p>

<p><em>REPENTANCE</em> means confessing all our sins&#8230; <em>REPENTANCE</em> means forsaking all sin, a complete turning away from being a rebel, from ungodly friends, form conformity with the world, from secret sins and habits of the flesh, from filthy books and naked photographs, from dirty stories and unclean jokes, from everything and everybody that would hinder you from being one hundred percent for Jesus Christ&#8230;</p>

<p><em>REPENTANCE</em> means making restitution. In other words, make your back paths straight; make things right with those whom you have wronged. This includes taking back stolen property or paying back stolen money. Restitution involves asking of forgiveness of parents for improper attitudes towards them, disobedience, and disrespect.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course most tracts aren&#8217;t intended to convert people to Christianity, just to satisfy the &#8216;evangelist&#8217; that they are doing their job by presenting the very worst of Christian judgementalism. Jack Chick&#8217;s <a href="http://www.stufffundieslike.com/2013/02/catholic-bashing/">rabid anti-Catholic sentiment makes this clear</a>:</p>

<p>Of course, people giving out these tracts don&#8217;t care about how the recipients receive them, they are really only there to give out as many tracts as quickly as possible <a href="http://www.stufffundieslike.com/2012/11/tract-smack-down/">to appease other Christians</a>:</p>
