  <div class="entry-content"><p>The pope has <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-23/pope-banishes-germany27s-bling-bishop-from-diocese/5041880">banished the &#8220;Bishop of Bling&#8221;</a> Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst over allegations of lying.</p>

<p>Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst announced that his diocean centre would cost 5.5 million euros in 2010, but the architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz-Peter_Tebartz-van_Elst">admitted that the true cost was known to be much higher from the start</a>, with plans for extravagant addons like half a million euros for art and 20,000 for a bathtub causing the project to blow out to 32 million euros. This came at a time when his staff were facing funding cuts because of a savings plan instituted a principle of austerity in the church.</p>

<p>The pope has <a href="http://michaeloloughlin.religionnews.com/2013/10/23/popes-financial-reforms/">instituted financial reforms</a> in the Vatican to encourage transparency and accountability, and to prevent money laundering. German dioceses are chafing under the new plans, which would reveal to their donors just how well-off they are.</p>

<p>As reported in the Religion News Service, German dioceses are among the world&#8217;s welthiest, and the diocese of Cologne is <a href="http://www.religionnews.com/2013/10/23/bishops-suspension-symptom-german-catholic-churchs-wealth/">richer than the Vatican</a>. By law, Germans registered as Catholics must give 8-10% of their tax revenue to the church, which gave the church $7.1 US billion in 2012. Even as over 100,000 members leave the church every year following child sex abuse scandals, the dioceses still have enormous asset reserves.</p>

<p>While the new Argentinian pope travells on a bus or in a donated 20 year old Renault his obstinate German subordinantes refuse to give up their BMWs and Audis. The previous pope took up a yearly collection of <a href="https://opentabernacle.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/popes-personal-income-200-million-annually/">$200 million US</a>, which will certainly guarantee him a comfortable life in retirement, while the new pope has opted to live in a single room in a guesthouse rather than his papal apartment.</p>

<blockquote><p>“The German Catholic Church is one of the country’s wealthiest and largest organizations and its top officials expect a certain lifestyle,” said Carsten Frerk, who has published two books on the German churches’ wealth and what he describes as their opaque financing. “But they are wary of the extent of their wealth becoming broadly known because it might lead to fewer donations.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Francis has commented that he <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/01/pope-francis-interview_n_4023659.html?utm_hp_ref=religion">dislikes careerist priests</a>, stating “It also happens to me that when I meet a clericalist, I suddenly become anti-clerical. Clericalism should not have anything to do with Christianity.”</p>

<p>Francis had stated in September that the Catholic Church was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24166434">too focussed on sexual issues</a> like homosexuality, abortion and contraception, and they must increase their focus on the poor and marginalised. This has apparently had little effect in the US, where the US Conference of Catholic Bishops <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/10/18/1248662/-Shutdown-losers-include-Catholic-Bishops">campaigned for Republicans to introduce religious priviliges</a> into the &#8216;must pass&#8217; resolution to end the government shutdown and avert a US government default. The shutdown cost 800,000 jobs and left poor families without food stamps for weeks, and resulted in the Republican party hitting the lowest approval rating of any political party recorded by Gallup. The government shutdown over Obamacare appears to be a <a href="http://thecontributor.com/religion/how-catholic-bishops-pushed-shutdown-%E2%80%93-and-even-default-%E2%80%93-over-birth-control">long-planned offensive from the USCCB</a>, with their opposition to Obamacare <a href="http://publicreligion.org/2012/08/as-catholics-go-so-goes-the-nation/">parroted by the Romney campaign</a>.</p>

<p>In Victoria, local communities are devastated that the Uniting Church is selling off between <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-17/730-anglican-church-story/5029694">$32 million</a> and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-11/uniting-church-puts-properties-up-for-sale-to-clear-debts/5015754">$100 million</a> worth of church properties to cover debts accumulated by the failure of Acacia College. The Church is considering selling <a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/north/ivanhoe-east-church-on-the-market-as-uniting-church-liquidates-properties/story-fnglenug-1226741089815">56 properties</a> after they had had run up $10 million dollars in debt because of legal issues with the developer, and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-10-18/catholic-church-considers-buying-acacia-college/4321504">unexpected infrastructure costs</a>.</p>

<p>While megachurches like Hillsong make <a href="www.heraldsun.com.au/money/money-matters/tax-office-push-for-charity-monitoring/story-fn312ws8-1225896551630">over $50 million dollars a year in tax-free profits</a>, paying their leaders more than $1.5 million a year, most small churches founded on volunteerism and support for charities have their supporter base dying off, with none of the flashy showmanship that attracts rich idiots into the Pentecostal churches.</p>

<p>Many of the parishioners were shocked to find that the churches they had been volunteering in and donating to for years, and for some, decades, were soon to be sold off. This is not the first time that local churches have been asked to bear the brunt of financial losses after a central church body loses millions. The Sydney Anglican church lost over $100 million by <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/millions-wiped-out-by-church-gambles-20090609-c29m.html">borrowing money to invest in shares before the GFC in 2009</a>, leading it to ask parishioners to take part in a planned but now unfunded evangelical sabotage of the Bible Society&#8217;s Jesus All About Life campaign. In February the Los Angeles Catholic diocese, after having paid $660 million dollars to settle more than 500 child sexual abuse cases <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/deaconsbench/2013/02/los-angeles-considering-capital-campaign-to-raise-200-million/">asked their parishioners for $200 million</a> for &#8220;repair and upkeep of our parish churches and schools.&#8221; This is after they had already managed to misappropriate $115 million from a grave maintenance fund <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/wwjtd/2013/02/the-los-angeles-diocese-found-some-new-funds/">into paying off child sexual assault victims</a>, without the knowledge or consent of the donors.</p>

<p>Most religionists would be completely shocked to find that the religion they&#8217;ve been trying to follow is completely different to the religion that their leaders use to gain money and power.</p>

<h3>Wider resentment of Prosperity Theology</h3>

<p>While in Germany the revelation of lying, selfish preachers is a scandal, in the US it&#8217;s nothing new. Peter Popoff was making $4 million a year when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Popoff">James Randi exposed him as a fraud</a>, and Bobby Tilton may have made as much as $80 million a year when he was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Tilton">found to be dumping the prayer requests his ministry took donations for</a>. The new Reality TV show Preachers of LA shows the glitzy and glamorous lives of Ferrari and Bentley driving pastors who fully embrace Prosperity Theology. Bishop Ron Gibson, with whom he had a child out of wedlock, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10406467/Meet-the-real-bishops-of-bling-the-Californian-preachers-of-prosperity-theology.html">boasts that fancy cars are not just for materialistic rappers</a></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;P Diddy and Jay-Z - they&#8217;re not the only ones who should be driving Ferraris and living in large houses,&#8221; he says to the camera as he compares himself to secular celebrities. To whoops from his congregation, he notes: &#8220;You see my bling, you see my Bentley, you see my glory but you don&#8217;t see my story.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `[]&#8217; for nil:NilClass</p>

<p>Baptist Pastors have a long history of playing their parishioners for mugs. Mark Barclay, a self proclaimed &#8220;Preacher of Righteousness&#8221; recently asked his followers for $79,000 for a paint job on his private jet, saying &#8221;<a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/televangelist-asks-followers-for-79k-to-do-paint-job-on-lords-jet-he-bought-last-year-98435/">the airplane does belong to Him [God] and not me and is used for His ministry and not personal use</a>.&#8221; He had the gall to cite Jesus&#8217;s words &#8220;do not store up treasures for yourself&#8221; to justify why his members should &#8220;sow&#8221; offerings for his million dollar jet.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a growing tide of criticism of prosperity theology. In a statement, Professor Stanley Hauerwas denounced the $1.7 million home of pastor Steve Furtick saying &#8220;It&#8217;s just vulgar. It&#8217;s an offense to the Gospel.&#8221; A number of media outlets are criticising pastors with private jets in <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2220833/Laughing-private-jet--93m-pastor-accused-exploiting-British-worshippers.html">Nigeria</a> and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andersonantunes/2013/01/17/the-richest-pastors-in-brazil/">Brazil</a>. A pastor who promised parishioners a miraculous new car if they would donate $52,000 for new blades for his private helicopter has lashed out at the media for publicizing the campaign, but not before widespread denunciation.</p>

<div class="youtube-lazy-link-info">Exclusive: Lee Atwater&#8217;s Infamous 1981 Interview on the Southern Strategy</div>
</a>
<div class="video-info" >In 1981, the legendarily brutal campaign consultant Lee Atwater, after a decade as South Carolina&#8217;s most effective Republican operative, was working in Ronald Reagan&#8217;s White House when he was interviewed by Alexander Lamis, a political scientist at Case Western Reserve University. 

In this audio, made public for the first time ever, Atwater lays out how Republicans can win the vote of racists without sounding racist themselves. Listen to the full audio and read Rick Perlstein&#8217;s analysis here: http://tnat.in/ffHKS</div>
</div>


<p>It has become, for liberals and leftists enraged by the way Republicans never suffer the consequences for turning electoral politics into a cesspool, a kind of smoking gun. The late, legendarily brutal campaign consultant Lee Atwater explains how Republicans can win the vote of racists without sounding racist themselves:
 
You start out in 1954 by saying, “Nigger, nigger, nigger.” By 1968 you can’t say “nigger”—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.… “We want to cut this,” is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than “Nigger, nigger.”
 
Now, the same indefatigable researcher who brought us Mitt Romney’s “47 percent” remarks, James Carter IV, has dug up the entire forty-two-minute interview from which that quote derives. Here, The Nation publishes it in its entirety for the very first time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently the LA Times has made waves with news that they <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-climate-change-letters-20131008,0,871615.story">censor untrue assertions from their opinion pages</a>. Astronomer Phil Plait writes to the LA Times to complain about their blatant spherist bias, and their failure to <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/10/10/an_open_letter_to_the_l_a_times_editors.html">teach the controversy on the flattness of the earth</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear L.A. Times Editors:
It has come to my attention that you will no longer be publishing letters to the editor from Flat-Earthers. This is an outrage, and shows your obvious spherist bias.</p>

<p>By taking the stance that the Earth is round, you are going against six thousand years of obvious truth. Look around you! Do you see the world curving down, away from you? Of course not. And the idea that we live on a thin skin of crust outside a giant sea of molten rock is simply ridiculous. If that were true, the ground would be warmer than the air above it! Duh.</p>

<p>The claim of a scientific consensus is another orbist lie. Have you not seen the Global Flattening Petition Project, which is signed by thousands of scientists* who know the true unbent shape of our planet? And don’t forget Geocentrismgate, where scientists’ emails revealed they say “The Moon rises at 8:30 tonight,” showing they clearly have been lying about heliocentrism, too.</p></blockquote>

It&#8217;s not the only important issue and I&#8217;ve got to say as far as an incoming Coalition government is concerned, the priority will be on things like reducing cost-of-living pressure and increasing job security.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>That must have been a &#8220;non-core&#8221; promise, given that George Brandis is almost straight away <a href="http://www.canberratimes.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/samesex-marriage-law-high-court-challenge-confirmed-20131010-2vaqe.html">working to overrule a law on same sex marriage the ACT wants to bring in</a>.
George Brandis has claimed that the ACT Bill would undermine the &#8216;well-established position&#8217; of &#8216;nationally consistent marriage laws.&#8217; The Tasmanian Law Reform commission suggests that this is possibly not the case, with a history of states passing their own marriage laws, so it&#8217;s unknown if the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-10/report-unable-to-predict-smooth-path-for-gay-marriage-laws/5013934">ACT bill will be found constitutional</a>. Politifact rates Brandis&#8217;s statement <a href="http://www.politifact.com.au/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/11/george-brandis/ACT-same-sex-marriage-equality-brandis/">as half true</a>.</p>

<p>While Abbott noted in the debate that same sex marriage was an &#8220;important&#8221; issue for his lesbian sister, his view on the issue has not &#8220;evolved&#8221; but goes against the majority of the Australian population. Figures from the ABC&#8217;s Vote Compass survey of 422,000 respondents show that the majority of Australians <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-29/vote-compass-gay-marriage-euthanasia-abortion/4918494">support same sex marriage, and 70% of those under 34 do</a>. This is in line with previous opinion polls finding that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognition_of_same-sex_unions_in_Australia#Public_opinion_polls">about 60% of the country now supports same sex marriage</a>.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s an old quote &#8220;every time you hear an ambulance siren, an opponent of gay rights is leaving the world or a supporter is entering it&#8221;. In reality, with NZ and the UK passing gay marriage laws it&#8217;s already a lost argument. The UK law will come into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage_in_the_United_Kingdom">effect in 2014</a>, I don&#8217;t think the Christian lobby can hold the issue back that much longer.</p>

<time datetime="2013-10-06T12:00:00+11:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Oct 6<span>th</span>, 2013</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Good post on the <a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/thinking-mistakes-8-common-mistakes-in-how-we-think-and-how-to-avoid-them">Buffer blog on cognitive errors</a>. There&#8217;s good discussion of Dan Ariely&#8217;s work on anchoring and pricing, as well as this classic about the conjuction fallacy:</p>

<blockquote><p>In 1983 Kahneman and Tversky tested how illogical human thinking is by describing the following imaginary person:</p>

<blockquote><p>Linda is thirty-one years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in antinuclear demonstrations.</p></blockquote>

<p>The researchers asked people to read this description, and then asked them to answer this question:</p>

<p>Which alternative is more probable?</p>

<ol>
<li>Linda is a bank teller.</li>
<li>Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.
Here’s where it can get a bit tricky to understand (at least, it did for me!)—If answer #2 is true, #1 is also true. This means that #2 cannot be the answer to the question of probability.</li>
</ol>


<p>Unfortunately, few of us realize this, because we’re so overcome by the more detailed description of #2. Plus, as the earlier quote pointed out, stereotypes are so deeply ingrained in our minds that subconsciously apply them to others.</p>

<p>Roughly 85% of people chose option #2 as the answer. A simple choice of words can change everything.</p></blockquote>

<p>Adding more detail or extra assumptions can make an event seem more plausible, even though the event necessarily becomes less probable. Kahneman and Tversky tried <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/ji/conjunction_fallacy/">another experiment on probabilities</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Consider a regular six-sided die with four green faces and two red faces.  The die will be rolled 20 times and the sequences of greens (G) and reds (R) will be recorded.  You are asked to select one sequence, from a set of three, and you will win $25 if the sequence you chose appears on successive rolls of the die.  Please check the sequence of greens and reds on which you prefer to bet.</p>

<ol>
<li>RGRRR</li>
<li>GRGRRR</li>
<li>GRRRRR</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>65% of respondents chose option 2 as the most likely bet, as it matches the colours of the 6 sides, even though the shorter sequence 1 requires less correct rolls to complete.</p>

<p>Another example of the conjunction fallacy</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>&#8220;A complete suspension of diplomatic relations between the USA and the Soviet Union, sometime in 1983.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;A Russian invasion of Poland, and a complete suspension of diplomatic relations between the USA and the Soviet Union, sometime in 1983.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Most respondents rate 2 as more likely than 1, even though 2 would necessarily entail 1, and it would be possible to have a complete suspension of diplomatic relations between the USA and USSR without invasion of any country, let alone Poland specifically.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/lg/the_affect_heuristic/">another example</a>, people&#8217;s perception</p>

<blockquote><p>Yamagishi (1997) showed that subjects judged a disease as more dangerous when it was described as killing 1,286 people out of every 10,000, versus a disease that was 24.14% likely to be fatal.  Apparently the mental image of a thousand dead bodies is much more alarming, compared to a single person who&#8217;s more likely to survive than not.</p>

<p>But wait, it gets worse.</p>

<p>Suppose an airport must decide whether to spend money to purchase some new equipment, while critics argue that the money should be spent on other aspects of airport safety.  Slovic et. al. (2002) presented two groups of subjects with the arguments for and against purchasing the equipment, with a response scale ranging from 0 (would not support at all) to 20 (very strong support).  One group saw the measure described as saving 150 lives.  The other group saw the measure described as saving 98% of 150 lives.  The hypothesis motivating the experiment was that saving 150 lives sounds vaguely good—is that a lot? a little?—while saving 98% of something is clearly very good because 98% is so close to the upper bound of the percentage scale.  Lo and behold, saving 150 lives had mean support of 10.4, while saving 98% of 150 lives had mean support of 13.6.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you have the time, consider how you&#8217;d approach a problem like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall problem</a> or this classic problem on breast cancer screening:</p>

<blockquote><p>1% of women at age forty who participate in routine screening have breast cancer.  80% of women with breast cancer will get positive mammographies.  9.6% of women without breast cancer will also get positive mammographies.  A woman in this age group had a positive mammography in a routine screening.  What is the probability that she actually has breast cancer?</p></blockquote>

<p>While most doctors give the intuitive answer of 80%, working though with Baysean logic gives the answer of 7.8%. Yudowsky has a <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/rational/bayes">long explanation</a> of the answer.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kevin Breel&#8217;s impassioned talk at TEDxKids on depression and the need for honesty has been going around on social media. Depression is a taboo topic, but it&#8217;s important for everyone like myself who don&#8217;t suffer from clinical depression to understand that the stigmatising of mental health issues can be more of a challenge for sufferers than their disease.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Conservatives love to bemoan how &#8220;Hollywood values&#8221; are not in line with their own views, and how the views of young people differing from their own must be a result of the media and colleges having a &#8220;liberal bias&#8221;. While the media that people consume may be an embodiment of cultural values at the time, unless anything particularly eggregious is being marketed to children that have no understanding of society&#8217;s views then this is mostly an overreaction. This particularly plays into the way that people view female musicians, that tend to be criticised simultaneously for beeing too sexual and not sexy enough.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to briefly look at a few female performers, and the kinds of expectations placed on them by different sectors of the community.</p>

<h3>Katy Perry - By the Grace of God</h3>

<p>Katy Perry started her musical career as a Christian singer writing songs on theology and her love of Jesus. While her breakthough hit <em>I Kissed a Girl</em> attracted international attention for it&#8217;s playful insinuation of lesbian experimentation, Perry has never really sexualised her image relative to other stars.</p>

<p>In a June 2012 interview Perry noted that her next album &#8220;would be a much darker album than the previous one. It was inevitable, after what I went through.&#8221;
She noted &#8220;When you lose something, all your foundations crumble-but that also <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5740580/katy-perrys-prism-the-billboard-cover-story?page=all">leaves a big hole that&#8217;s open for something great to come through</a>.&#8221; The album has gone in dark directions for some tracks, <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5740580/katy-perrys-prism-the-billboard-cover-story?page=0%2C1">as billboard notes</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Self-help and astrological references abound on tracks like <em>Spiritual</em> and <em>Legendary Lovers,</em> reflecting Perry&#8217;s recent immersion in Transcendental Meditation and mindfulness therapy. Elsewhere, Perry pointedly confronts her turbulent recent history. The line &#8220;You sent a text/It&#8217;s like the wind changed your mind&#8221; from <em>Ghost</em> references how Brand delivered the news he wanted a divorce. <em>By the Grace of God,</em> meanwhile, begins with Perry lying on the floor of a bathroom, fighting suicidal thoughts. &#8220;That song is evident of how tough it really was at a certain point. I asked myself, &#8216;Do I want to endure? Should I continue living?&#8217;&#8221; Perry says. &#8220;All the songs are real-life moments. I can only write autobiographically. I put all the evidence in the music. I tell my fans if they want to know the real truth about stuff, just listen to the songs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>A few of the lyrics are particularly interesting:</p>

<blockquote><p>Thought I wasn&#8217;t enough<br/>
found I wasn&#8217;t so tough<br/>
Laying on the bathroom floor<br/>
We were living on a front line<br/>
and I felt the fault was all mine<br/>
Couldn&#8217;t take it anymore</p>

<p>By the grace of God<br/>
There was no other way<br/>
I picked myself back up<br/>
I knew I had to say<br/>
I put one foot in front of the other and I<br/>
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay<br/>
Wasn&#8217;t gonna let love take me out that way</p></blockquote>

<p>Love is a reference to her ex-husband Brand.</p>

<blockquote><p>I thank my sister for keeping my head above the water<br/>
When the truth was like swallowing sand<br/>
Now, every morning, oh there is no more morning<br/>
Oh, I can finally see myself again</p>

<p><strong>I know I am enough, possible to be loved</strong><br/>
It was not about me<br/>
Now I have to raise above<br/>
Let the Universe call the bluff<br/>
Yeah, <strong>the truth will set you free</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>The phrase <strong><em>the truth will set you free</em></strong> is a quote from Jesus speaking in John 8, leading many to speculate that this is a homage to her past as a singer in Christian contemporary music.</p>

<h3>Miley Cyrus</h3>

<p>When Destiny Hope Cyrus rose to fame after being cast in Disney&#8217;s Hannah Montanna, many were enamoured with the country singer&#8217;s daughter from the buckle of the bible belt. To add to her family friendly charm, she described her Christian faith as &#8221;<a href="http://www.parade.com/celebrity/2010/03/miley-cyrus.html">very important</a>&#8221; and wrote about keeping the faith in <em>The Climb</em>. Some even saw her as part of a new movement of conservative Christian public figures that would bring the US <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130703010527/http://conservapedia.com/Essay:The_Coming_Fifth_Great_Awakening_in_America">back to social conservatism in a new great awakening</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/cyrus-c.png" alt="Conservapedia praises Cyrus's Christianity" /></p>

<p>Cyrus in 2007 described her stardom as being &#8221;<a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-01-10-miley-cyrus_x.htm">God&#8217;s will</a>&#8221;, promising that she wouldn&#8217;t start going crazy under the spotlight.</p>

<blockquote><p>In a pop culture filled with young hot starlets gone wild, isn&#8217;t Billy Ray worried that pretty Miley will soon start doing nutty Britney Spears-eque things, like not wearing underpants?</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s never wore underwear,&#8221; Billy Ray says without missing a beat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad!&#8221; Miley says.</p></blockquote>

<p>Miley went on to present an increasingly edgy image, with most media outlets <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/let-me-explain-why-miley-cyrus-vma-performance-was,33632/">disproportionately covering her antics instead of actual news</a>. This is the <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/Qy8xE">latest controvertial act</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/cyrus.gif" alt="Cyrus VMA performance" /></p>

<p>Why would she do such a thing? Probably because Professor Lawrence Krauss has addled her brain:</p>

<p><img src="/images/cyrus-1.png" alt="Cyrus tweeting a beautiful quote from Lawrence Krauss" /></p>

<p>Sinead O&#8217;Connor wrote an <a href="http://www.sineadoconnor.com/2013/10/open-letter-to-miley-cyrus/">open letter to Cyrus, complaining that she regrets her record label pushing her to be too sexual</a>. Cyrus responded that she was <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/music/miley-to-sinead-im-too-busy--performing-and-hosting-on-tv-to-write-back-20131004-2uy8m.html">too busy to write back</a>, though the whole thing has turned ugly with mental health issues being discussed publicly.</p>

<p>Amanda Palmer weighed in, commenting that she finds some performers want to be sexually powerful on stage, and that <a href="http://amandapalmer.net/blog/20131003/">they themselves push to expose themselves more on stage</a>, noting:</p>

<blockquote><p>“It’s a Chinese finger trap that reflects the basic problems of our women-times: we’re either scolded for looking sexy or we’re scolded for not playing the game. Those who manage to find a perfect balance are rare, and the culture at large seems hellbent on undermining our ability to create that balance peacefully within ourselves. And weirdly, it’s generally women scolding other women…we’re our own worst enemies.”</p></blockquote>

<h3>Rhianna</h3>

<p>&#8220;Pour it up&#8221; is very much on the pro-sex side of the equation by making a song about stripping, and about half of the youtube votes are negative.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Popular Science recently announced that they are shutting down the comments for new articles, as they can skew the readers into <a href="http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-09/why-were-shutting-our-comments">distrusting the expertise of scientists</a>. Recent studies have found that incivility in the comment section can alter the perception of the credibility of the articles they accompany. In one study, readers of a fake blog post on nanotechnology were asked to evaluate it&#8217;s impact, with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/opinion/sunday/this-story-stinks.html?_r=0">one group exposed to vituperative comments</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p> Uncivil comments not only polarized readers, but they often changed a participant&#8217;s interpretation of the news story itself.<br/>
 In the civil group, those who initially did or did not support the technology — whom we identified with preliminary survey questions — continued to feel the same way after reading the comments. Those exposed to rude comments, however, ended up with a much more polarized understanding of the risks connected with the technology.<br/>
 Simply including an ad hominem attack in a reader comment was enough to make study participants think the downside of the reported technology was greater than they&#8217;d previously thought.</p></blockquote>

<p>In a world where more and more discussion of contemporary issues happens online, this does not bode well for the public understanding of the importance of science, alread <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/opinion/welcome-to-the-age-of-denial.html">at all time lows</a>. As people search out information about health online, &#8220;Dr Google&#8221; can mislead patients and present <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/bigideas/stories/2011/04/28/3202794.htm">debunked information wrongly suggesting that vaccines don&#8217;t work</a>. A decentralised media landscape should have the ability to route around authoritarian regimes that try to censor it, but what happens when it undermines the structures that support the public respect of useful institutions?</p>

<p>Carl Sagan fundamentaly believed that the populace deserved to be educated about science, so that political or religious charlatans wouldn&#8217;t lure them into the next deception. Noting that either the people control the government or the government controls the people, he fiercely advocated that the science of evolution be taught in public schools so that the people could choose to understand science for themselves:</p>

<p>Benkler, in his 2006 book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Networks">The Wealth of Networks</a> portended a networked society enriched by freely available peer-produced cultural works in a shared online commons like wikipedia. The utipian visions of such an information ecosystem, however, have to be reconciled with the reality that most people are unaware of their own cognitive biases, and are increasingly polarised on science and other issues in the management of polities. Without educating people on cognative biases and getting them to understand the world as it is, not as they want it to be, then potentially a decentrilised internet will simply fracture people into tribal teams who all see things the same way. Unfortunately, some content algorithms are set up to give users content <a href="http://www.thefilterbubble.com/ted-talk">similar to what they&#8217;ve already seen</a> potentially limiting their exposure to information that contradicts their beliefs. Similarly, asking a search engine to find information on &#8220;global warming <em>science</em>&#8221; or &#8220;global warming <em>conspiracy</em>&#8221; may find different sets of sites, without the questioner perceiving any bias in their own question, and assuming that the results they see are representitive of the information as a whole.</p>

<p>In conclusion to all of this, the reason I don&#8217;t have comments is that like Popular Science, I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re particularly helpful.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Pope Francis has recently made international headlines by suggesting <a href="www.americamagazine.org/pope-interview">that the Catholic Church is too focused on gays and abortion</a>. This follows from his earlier comments that <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/pope-francis-assures-atheists-you-dont-have-to-believe-in-god-to-go-to-heaven-8810062.html">atheists who follow their conscience might be able to go to heaven</a> and that he isn&#8217;t in a position to judge <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/pope-on-gay-priests-who-am-i-to-judge-20130730-2qvh9.html">celibate gay Catholics</a>. This is a major turnaround from the culture war style dealings with the public the church pushed under Benedict, culminating in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Declaration:_A_Call_of_Christian_Conscience">Manhattan Declaration</a>&#8217;s popularity.</p>

<p>Most of the current culture war issues revolve around <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/category/topics/feminism">gender politics</a>, and these disputes likely go back to the start of the church. This history channel documentary presents expert opinions on New Testament apocrypha, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Paul_and_Thecla">Acts of Paul and Thecla</a></p>

<div class="video-info" >Travel back to the blistering sands of the Holy Land, into the onion-domed chapels of Eastern Orthodox churches and onto the pages of the Koran. Unearth the trail of chapters that were left out of the ultimate version of the Scriptures. Included in the Koran is &#8220;The Life of Adam and Eve,&#8221; a detailed account of the creation story written before Jesus was born. The incestuous account of &#8220;The Book of Jubilees&#8221; was included in the Orthodox Old Testament and the Dead Sea Scrolls. &#8220;The Book of Enoch,&#8221; an ancient bestseller, relates the story of the man said in Genesis to have walked with God and been assumed directly into heaven. This fascinating collection offers a fresh perspective on the figures at the foundation of faith.</div>

<p>Thecla, as <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/maps/primary/thecla.html">the story goes</a>, was a student of Paul&#8217;s that loved his preaching on asceticism and celibacy. After telling her fiance that she was no longer interested in marrying him, he became furious and sought out Paul to demand he stop teaching that virgins should remain chaste. He raised a multitude of angry husbands who were furious their wives stopped wanting sex, and brought Paul and Thecla to the governor, who condemned Paul to flogging and and Thecla to burning at the stake as a warning against their teachings. While Thecla was being brought to her pyre, she looked around for Paul, and saw in the crowd a vision of Jesus who ascended to heaven. Fixing her gaze on heaven as the pyre was lit, a miraculous hailstorm extinguished the flames, saving her. I find it interesting that while this story is entirely fictional, it has a number of similarities to the death of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_of_arc">Joan of Arc</a>.</p>

<p>Paul, it is said, then allowed Thecla to travel with him throughout the land, so long as she didn&#8217;t let her looks tempt the people. In Antioch, an magistrate called Alexander was taken with her, and grabbed her and kissed her as his way of proposition. Vowed to chastity, Thecla responded by knocking the crown off his head and ripping his cloak open so as to humiliate him in front of the people he ruled. Ashamed, Alexander took her to the governor who ordered her be thrown to the lions. Alexander had support from the men of the town, but the women of the town felt sympathy for the virgin and felt the punishment unjust. Before being cast into the amphitheatre to confront her fate, Thecla cried out in faith to her god to protect her innocence, and a she-lion fiercer than all the beasts fell down before her. The she-lion then killed the beasts that attacked Thecla, including male lions and a she-bear. This is probably a reference to Elisha&#8217;s she-bears, and Daniel&#8217;s lions.</p>

<div class="figure"><a href="http://dashinvaine.deviantart.com/art/Thecla-in-the-Arena-373006770"><img src="/images/thecla-lions.jpg" link="http://dashinvaine.deviantart.com/art/Thecla-in-the-Arena-373006770" title="Thecla and the lions by Gordon Napier" ><p>Thecla and the lions by Gordon Napier</span></a></div>


<p>Next Thecla decided to baptise herself in a pool of sharks. Upon baptising herself in the name of Jesus, the sharks were struck with fire and lightning, and she was protected with a ring of fire. The women threw ointments into the field to knock out the other animals, so Alexander brought in his strongest bulls to have Thecla tied to. So the governor&#8217;s men tied a rope around Thecla&#8217;s waist to bulls that became enraged when hit by a hot poker in the nads. But the divine fire around Thecla burned off the rope fastened to the members of the bulls. When a powerful widow and relative of Caesar collapsed with worry for Thecla, the governor put an end to her trials fearing for his reputation, and officially pardoned Thecla. Thecla proclaimed the message of Christianity, converting many young men and women, and dressed as a man, led her new followers to find Paul who had run off amongst the commotion.</p>

<p>Thecla then went about the land preaching and performing miraculous healings, and set up a monastery where a large number of young women pledged their chastity. Tales of her miracles caused the sick in adjacent countries to travel to her for healing, making the local physicians furious at the competition, so they plotted to kill her. They decided that the virgin priestess must be raped to lose her powers, so conspired to pay local youths to assault her. They announced to her their intent to lie with her, before she cried out to heaven to save her chastity, and she ran into a miraculous fissure in a rock that closed up behind her, saving her one last time.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of things in this story that the early church fathers would have found objectionable, including the claim that Paul preached asceticism. But one of the most interesting things is how virginity went against the culture of the time. The story has Paul preaching that married couples should stay chaste, and while some <a href="http://blackamericaweb.com/129296/christian-couple-maintains-abstinence-two-years-after-marriage/">loopy couples today manage this for two whole years</a> most of the church&#8217;s preaching has changed to pro-natalist ideas. Interestingly, this may only have come after Paul and Jesus, as both believed that an apocalypse was coming in their lifetime, and children were unnecessary. Bart Ehrman has argued in <em>Forged</em> that 1 Thessalonians and parts of 1 Corinthians are a forgery of Pauline writings. This would actually fit with an asceticist Paul being watered down by later authors wanting to focus on childbearing, and making Christianity compatible with the Roman society of the time.</p>

<p>Justin Martyr, facing Roman persecution, presented his argument that Christianity was less of a threat to Roman order than atheistic philosophers like Socrates. The earlier church would have faced similar persecution, and had the similar desire to make Christianity seem compatible with the Roman culture of the time. In Book 1 of Politics Aristotle writes that the hierarchy of the state should be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_code">matched by the &#8220;building block&#8221; of the family</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Seeing then that the state is made up of households, before speaking of the state we must speak of the management of the household. The parts of the household are the persons who compose it, and a complete household consists of slaves and freemen. Now we should begin by examining everything in its least elements; and the first and least parts of a family are master and slave, husband and wife, father and children. We have therefore to consider what each of these three relations is and ought to be:—I mean the relation of master and servant, of husband and wife, and thirdly of parent and child.</p></blockquote>

<p>Plato advocates husbands ruling over their wives, <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Politics_(Jowett)/Book_I#Different_kinds_of_rule_within_the_household:_.281.29_rule_of_master_over_slaves.3B_.282.29_of_father_over_children.3B_.283.29_of_husband_over_wife.">criticising Socrates for advocating for equality between the sexes</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>A husband and father rules over wife and children, both free, but the rule differs, the rule over his children being a royal, over his wife a constitutional rule. For although there may be exceptions to the order of nature, the male is by nature fitter for command than the female, just as the elder and full-grown is superior to the younger and more immature&#8230; moral virtue belongs to all of them; but the temperance of a man and of a woman, or the courage and justice of a man and of a woman, are not, as Socrates maintained, the same; the courage of a man is shown in commanding, of a woman in obeying</p></blockquote>

<p>Philo of Alexandria similarly reflected on the society of his time by documenting the importance of men controlling their families:</p>

<blockquote><p>if you ask any one of them about their national laws or customs, they can all tell you at once, without any difficulty; and the husband appears to be a master, endowed with sufficient authority to explain these laws to his wife, a father to teach them to his children, and a master to his servants.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Many Christian writers would have wanted to make Christianity compatible with these household codes, and the similar decrees that women submit to their husbands, save themselves in childbirth, and never preach (in Colossians, Ephesians, 1 Timothy, Titus and 1 Peter) may be a response to the Roman culture of the time. It may also be a way on clamping down on radical women&#8217;s movement of virgins that would have sprung up in the wake of texts like the Acts of Paul and Thecla, pushing for women to gain power over the men by denying their husbands sex - the one area in which they wielded considerable power. Even in times when women have jobs and education, there is widespread anxiety over the <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2012/06/27/the-ugly-side-of-modesty/">&#8220;sexualisation&#8221; of girls</a>, as though female sexuality is some dangerous, destabilising force.</p>

<p>All non-apocalyptic religions emphasise marriage, childbearing and family. Studies have found that when people are in a room with highly attractive people, they are <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/collections/201107/will-atheism-replace-religion/religious-piety-mating-strategy">more drawn to religious ideas that emphasise monogamy</a>. In nearly every religion, teachings can be conveniently cherry picked to conform to the type of <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/camelswithhammers/2013/06/fck-me-in-the-ass-because-i-love-jesus/">reproductive strategy that the adherent wants to achieve</a>.</p>
