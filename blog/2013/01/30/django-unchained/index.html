<div class="entry-content"><p>Quentin Tarantino&#8217;s latest spaghetti western and blaxploitation inspired film. QT takes on the brutality of the slave culture in the antebellum South as he did the Holocaust in <strong>Inglorious Basterds</strong>. Christoph Waltz played a German in both films, giving a much more convincing performance in Django as Dr Shultz, a bounty hunter who hates slavers. Through his partnership with freed slave Django (Jamie Foxx) they go on a blood soaked rampage for justice and vengeance. Ebert calls the ending a &#8220;satisfactory Quentonian celebration of violence&#8221;. Django has been criticised for excessive on-screen violence and a release date two weeks from the Conneticuit mass murder. Of course this is a <a href="/blog/2013/01/20/rick-perry/">standard diversionary tactic against real political action</a>. QT&#8217;s use of grindhouse storytelling leaves moralisers in a panic and fans and critics expressing strong approval in a measured fashion. Tarantino has also come under fire for the script&#8217;s frequent use of the n-word, which <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-jamie-foxx-django-unchained-n-word-leonardo-dicaprio-20121220,0,2556146.story">the actors found uncomfortable</a>. QT tackles the heavy subject of slavery without succumbing to moralising, creating entertainment (with unexpectedly humorous scenes) for a wide audience. And in some ways, that&#8217;s probably why conservatives hate it.</p>

<p>Throughout film history audiences have been influenced by abridged accounts of historical events. Discussing <strong>Battleship Potemkin</strong>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battleship_Potemkin#The_Odessa_Steps_sequence">Roger Ebert writes</a>,</p>

<blockquote><p>That there was, in fact, no czarist massacre on the Odessa Steps scarcely diminishes the power of the scene &#8230; It is ironic that [Eisenstein] did it so well that today, the bloodshed on the Odessa steps is often referred to as if it really happened.</p></blockquote>

<p>There&#8217;s been a strong critic reaction to <strong>Zero Dark Thirty</strong> with its positive portrayal of &#8220;enhanced interrogation techniques&#8221;, with an ex-CIA official calling the movie <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2013/jan/14/oscars-boycott-zero-dark-thirty">an &#8220;infomercial&#8221; for their techniques</a>. The film does not explicitly say that torture helped to gain information to capture Bin Laden, it only makes that suggestion by designating half an hour at the start of the film to interrogations. Even people who know that no information was gained on Bin Laden through torture, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/01/zero-dark-thirty-debate-torture-has-no-place-in-a-civilized-society/">presenting it as a standard part of a modern intelligence operation is morally dubious</a>.</p>

<p>The history shows not only did torture fail to produce useful information other than what was already gained without using &#8220;enhanced&#8221; techniques, faulty information <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/23/opinion/la-oe-1223-mcdermott-torture-bigelow-zero-dark-20121223">sent the CIA on a wild goose chase</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The simple fact is you can&#8217;t reliably separate the gold from the dross that torture yields. &#8220;He had us chasing the goddamn geese in Central Park because he said some of them had explosives stuffed up their ass,&#8221; one FBI counter-terrorism agent said in frustration</p></blockquote>

<p>Audiences of historical fiction should be mindful that the presentation of events they see may have little to do with actual history. When one of Django&#8217;s characters, the ugly, sadistic Big John Brittle starts whipping a black slave girl for breaking eggs while holding a bible in his left hand and recounting scripture, I was dubious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_Fiction#Jules.27s_Bible_passage">given Tarantino&#8217;s history of making up bible passages</a>. Lo and behold, the text of the bible passage is accurate, Genesis 9:2 &#8220;The fear of ye, and the dread of ye, shall be on every beast of the Earth&#8221;. Some have questioned whether Tarantino, an atheist, is laying it on a bit thick by with Brittle having three pages from the bible sewn to his clothes while being an outlaw wanted dead or alive.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/dj-145.jpeg" title="Big John Brittle shot in Django Unchained" ></p>

<p>But really, considering the context, this isn&#8217;t pantomime at all. Students of the pseudoscience of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrenology">phrenology</a> considered the brains of Europeans the &#8220;most beautiful&#8221; when compared to &#8220;lesser&#8221; races, as blacks lacked the part of the brain capable of producing artists. Considering Genesis 9, the biblical account of the result of Yahweh&#8217;s global flood is that the world must be repopulated from Noah&#8217;s descendents, Shem, Ham and Japeth.</p>

<blockquote><p> Noah, a man of the soil, began to plant a vineyard. <em>21</em> When he drank some of the wine, he got drunk and uncovered himself inside his tent. <em>22</em> Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father&#8217;s nakedness and told his two brothers who were outside. <em>23</em> Shem and Japheth took the garment and placed it on their shoulders. Then they walked in backwards and covered up their father&#8217;s nakedness. Their faces were turned the other way so they did not see their father&#8217;s nakedness.</p>

<p> 24 When Noah awoke from his drunken stupor he learned what his youngest son had done to him. 25 So he said,</p>

<p> &#8220;Cursed be Canaan!<br/>
 The lowest of slaves<br/>
 he will be to his brothers.&#8221; <br/>
 26 He also said,</p>

<p> &#8220;Worthy of praise is the LORD, the God of Shem! <br/>
 May Canaan be the slave of Shem!<br/>
 27 May God enlarge Japheth&#8217;s territory and numbers!<br/>
 May he live in the tents of Shem <br/>
 and may Canaan be his slave!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>And so because Ham didn&#8217;t cover up his father&#8217;s nakedness, instead left his father&#8217;s tent to tell his brothers and laugh at his father (and possibly bring out Noah&#8217;s garment to show his brothers, before they honourably bring back &#8220;the garment&#8221;) all of Ham&#8217;s descendants are cursed to be the <strong>עֶבֶד עֲבָדִים eved avadim</strong>, the lowest of slaves. The curse is pronounced on Canaan, not Ham.</p>

<p>While Genesis 9 only mentiones the Canaanites (Phoenecia/Palestine) as the people group under the curse of slavery from Ham, Genesis 10:6 also mentions the Cush (Nubia/Ethiopia), Mizraim (Egypt) and Put (Libya). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Ham">Traditional Christian understanding asserts that Japheth went on to father the people group that became Western Europeans and Caucasians</a>. Therefore this simplistic literal understanding of Genesis has been used for generations to support the idea that black people were under a curse from God to serve the white people as slaves. Unfortunately this is <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/texas-public-school-course-teaches-racial-origins-traced-noah">still being taught as gospel in Southern public schools</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/RacialOriginsNoah.jpg" title="Racial Origins from Noah's Decendents" ></p>

<p>The belief that African people are born to serve Caucasians as the &#8216;lowest of slaves&#8217; is alive and well in Texas. How do these types respond to the film? <a href="http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2012/12/12/the-conservative-backlash-against-django-unchained-began-today">With widespread admiration, of course</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Django Unchained is hard-core Cultural Marxism. Supporters of this doctrine believe that the best way to get the American public to accept Marxism and Totalitarianism is to denigrate, defame, and ridicule Western Civilization, moral values, Christianity, and the family unit. It was devised by the Frankfurt School in the 1930s.</p>

<p>The movie is being released on Christmas Day as a way of denigrating Christmas and the Christian faith.</p>

<p>Jamie Foxx, the star of Django Unchained is promoting the movie by going on anti-white racial rants in public. This weekend, on Saturday Night Live, he stated “I get to kill all the white people, how great is that!”</p></blockquote>

<p>Other than slavery being banned in the South, the only thing that seems to have changed is that now they have to call heroic black figures &#8216;socialist&#8217; when in public. I bet they&#8217;ll love the next 4 years.</p>
