<div class="entry-content"><p>A team of Harvard psychologists recently completed a study showing a correlation between religious belief and performance on the well-known Cognitive Reflection Test The CRT goes like this; consider these simple maths quesions:</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total.  The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball.  How much does the ball cost?</li>
<li>If it takes five machines five minutes to make five widgets, how long does it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?</li>
<li>In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads.  Every day, the patch doubles in size.  If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>You may have confidence in your answers. The answers are below these optical illusions, that show how you interpret the world may be mistaken:</p>

<p><img src="/images/illusion-Zollner.png" alt="Zollner Illusion" /></p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%B6llner_illusion">Zöllner illusion</a> demonstrates that while lines actually run in parallel, they look wonky when a pattern makes you believe that they aren&#8217;t straight.</p>

<p><img src="/images/illusion-pisa789.jpg" alt="Double Leaning Tower of Pisa Illusion" /></p>

<p>Both of these images are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaning_tower_illusion">exactly the same</a>. Try covering one of them with your hand. When you see both images along side each other, your mind automatically assumes that the one on the right must come from a different angle.</p>

<p><strong>Answers</strong>:</p>

<ol>
<li>You would expect the ball to cost $0.10 if the bat cost $1.00, but the bat costs $1.00 <em>more</em> than the ball, giving the correct answer of <strong>$0.05</strong></li>
<li>While the intuitive answer is 100 minutes, it takes five machines five minutes to produce one widget each, so it takes 100 machines five minutes to produce one widget each (100 widgets).</li>
<li>The intuitive answer is half the days (24), the correct answer is 47 (because the patch doubles each day).</li>
</ol>


<p>These aren&#8217;t difficult questions, but many people get the answers wrong when they don&#8217;t think the problem though methodically, relying on intuition instead of slow, methodical, rational thought. More religious people <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matthew-hutson/what-kind-of-thinker-beli_b_2759701.html">tend to get more of the answers wrong</a>, trusting their intuition more than less religious participants.</p>

<p>David Hume said &#8220;reason is the slave of the passions&#8221; and modern neuroscience backs the claim up.
Daniel Kahneman has noted differences in the way that people <a href="http://edge.org/conversation/the-marvels-and-flaws-of-intuitive-thinking">process information quickly and intuitively, compared to how they think slowly and methodically</a>.</p>

<p>Very often we can fail to spot things that we&#8217;re not looking out for. Today <em>Scientific American</em> published an article on selective attention, where people can fail to notice the things &#8221;<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=your-hidden-censor-what-your-mind-will-not-let-you-see&amp;page=1">your mind will not let you see</a>.&#8221; In one study white women were asked to concentrate on a ball-tossing video, then asked if they noticed a black man or a white man in the middle. One group primed on a task aimed at finding a &#8220;a suitable neighbor or co-worker&#8221; were equally likely to see both men. Another group primed on looking for a friend or date noticed the white man more than twice as often as the black man.</p>

<p>Many societies that have multicultural workplaces don&#8217;t have as many mixed ethnicity marriages, meaning that many people may be more subconsiously accustomed to seeing people of other races in a distant setting but not as accustomed to them being friends or family. In several studies where participants <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/108/13/E46.full">were given a shot of oxytocin</a>, the participants showed increased trust and co-operation with their in-group, while maintaining the same level of trust with their out-group. In <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/108/4/1262.full">one study</a>, participants performed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_Association_Test">implicit association test</a>, where participants are timed in their categorisation of images of faces by grouping them with words that have positive or negative emotions. We often perceive visual information quickly, while rationally processing it takes longer. The Scientific American article mentions a similar study:</p>

<blockquote><p>On some trials of their experiment, one eye saw a neutral picture like a lamp, and the other eye saw a bloody scene of violence. On other trials, one eye saw a neutral picture and the other saw an erotic nude picture. The subjects’ conscious experiences of the pictures flipped back and forth, but the scenes of sex and violence were more likely to be the first ones seen, and they occupied consciousness much longer than the boring neutral images. Several studies have now confirmed that dangerous things like snakes, angry men, and snarling dogs can break through our concentration and intrude on consciousness. Dirty words and naughty pictures have the same effects&#8230; If it gets your heart racing it will get your attention.</p></blockquote>

<p>Make sure you don&#8217;t get distracted when considering the beautiful dolphins on this bottle:</p>

<p><img src="/images/dolphinsex.jpg" alt="Dolphin Illusion" /></p>

<p>In a hunter-gatherer context, humans would need to interrupt their slow thinking processes to quickly react to a predator that suddenly appears, leaving us with sex and violence being distracting and intensely engaging in ways that reflective modes of thought aren&#8217;t. Why else would there be so much sex and violence on HBO shows like <em>Game of Thrones</em>?</p>

<p>The article goes on with this clincher:</p>

<blockquote><p>There is something particularly disquieting about this brand of bias, because there is a power asymmetry. The unconscious screener shapes what the conscious “you” gets to see, but the conscious “you” doesn’t have veto power over that decision. Of course, you could try to shift your attention or change your goals once you are aware of them, but by then it may be too late. The unconscious always has a head start.</p></blockquote>

<p>Jonathan Haidt likens fast and slow thinking to an <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/the-mind-has-an-elephant-of-its-own/2006/07/25/1153816179991.html?page=fullpage">emotional elephant with a rational rider</a>. The rider likes to think that he is in control, but really, the much larger elephant has most of the say in what direction the pair takes. In <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/files/emotional_dog_and_rational_tail.pdf">The Emotional Dog and its Rational Tail</a> Haidt states &#8220;moral reasoning is usually a post-hoc construction, generated after a judgment has been reached.&#8221; We assume that we are in control of our decisions, and yet psychology and behavioral economics shows that most of our rational decisions are a &#8220;slave&#8221; to the snap emotional judgements we make.</p>

<p>Consider Eddie McGuire&#8217;s <a href="http://theconversation.com/racism-in-the-afl-eddie-mcguire-and-the-media-prove-theres-still-a-long-way-to-go-14838">likening of Adam Goodes to King Kong</a> after nearly a week of condemning racially villifying remarks about Aboriginal AFL players. This doesn&#8217;t just highlight Eddie McGuire&#8217;s stupidity but points to the wider problem of people allowing racial stereotypes to colour their sentiments of people, while denying to themselves and others that any bias exists. Even people sincerely opposed to racism can act in <a href="http://theconversation.com/are-you-racist-you-may-be-without-even-knowing-it-10826">ways that express biases without knowing it</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Here’s an example of how this kind of thing can occur, from a <a href="http://socialjudgments.com/docs/Uhlmann%20and%20Cohen%202005.pdf">2005 American study</a>.
In this study, participants were asked to choose the better applicant
for the job of police chief. There were two candidates. One was “street
wise” while the other had more formal education. One was male, one was
female. Some experimental subjects were given the choice between a male
street wise applicant and a female formally educated applicant, while
some got the options reversed, with the female applicant being the
street wise one.</p>

<p>Here’s the interesting finding – both groups tended to pick the male
applicant as the better qualified. They justified this choice by
reference to the qualification the female lacked&#8230;</p>

<p>It looked as though they were making a judgement based on what qualifications they thought were required for police chief. They weren’t really: they were making a judgement based on gender, and justifying it, based on a confabulated theory about what qualifications were required for police chief.</p></blockquote>

<p>Similarly, when right of centre voters criticise Gillard in an excessively personal way (&#8220;Ju-liar&#8221;), a confabulatory process may mask mysoginistic attitudes as a justified criticism of her character and agenda. Worse, a tribal grouping of people who agree with each other&#8217;s politics encourages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_cognition">cultural cognition</a>, with their own biases being confirmed by mostly talking with people who agree. Worse still is when they believe that their group is <a href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Sherif/chap7.htm">pitted against other groups, rather than a part of a political system that has the whole country&#8217;s interests at heart</a>. This will mean going beyong the current 24 hour news cycle driven vituperative personality politics and trying to find bipartisan unity in policy based discourse.</p>

<p>Many figures like Haidt <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jonathan_haidt_how_common_threats_can_make_common_political_ground.html">want the media to stop feeding into a cycle of partisanship on critical issues</a> like US spending on prison systems, which has liberals denouncing the incaceration rates of ethnic minorities, conservatives concerned at <a href="http://www.rightoncrime.com/the-conservative-case-for-reform/what-conservatives-are-saying/">prisons expenditure risking the bankruptcy of several US states</a> and both concerned at <a href="/blog/2013/01/03/rentier-theology/">bribery of the judiciary to raise sentences to increase demand for prison builders</a>.</p>

<p>If smart people can become more aware of their own biases, then they may be more likely to see the things that their subconsious may otherwise ignore, like successful people from racial minorities (or moonwalking bears). Then racism and sexism won&#8217;t be as much of a concern.</p>

<p>Online media has the potential to diversify the sources of information that people receive, as well as the potential to propagate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP4A6SbRdzM&amp;t=4m37s">extreme crank theories</a>. My belief is that if enough people are able to have a committment to consider the evidence rather than interpret facts though their own filter, then the good will outweigh the bad and most people will benefit from a rational discussion on important issues.</p>
