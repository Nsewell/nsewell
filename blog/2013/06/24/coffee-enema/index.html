<div class="entry-content"><p>No, wait, you can&#8217;t. Jessica Ainscough, a self proclaimed &#8220;wellness warrior&#8221; has recently complained that she felt &#8220;dirty&#8221; after eating a vegan burger that wasn&#8217;t 100% organic. The burger was billed by the not-for-profit vegetarian cafe as &#8220;cancer fighting rather than cancer causing.&#8221; Ainscough later rang the cafe to check up on some of their claims, but not whether any of the claimed miraculous healing properties had any empirical basis, but rather if their food was 100% organic. The revelation that her burger and juice weren&#8217;t purely organic made her feel like such a dirty, dirty woman that <a href="http://www.thewellnesswarrior.com.au/2013/06/beware-of-organic-cafes-that-lie-to-us/">she needed detoxifying</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>I felt dirty. <strong>I felt like I needed to give my insides about 10 showers</strong>. I was so shocked that I just hung up the phone, but I wish I’d told her that her since her “cancer fighting” burger contains pesticides it is actually cancer causing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Emphasis hers. The poor woman is very slowly dying of a rare type of cancer, epithelioid sarcoma, which tends to show up in young patients. Unfortunately, with no paletable treatment options available, the woman has chosen to believe in the claimed &#8220;natural healing power&#8221; of miracle diets to avoid acknowledging her fate. The yellow journalism of the Daily Tele <a href="http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/restaurants-bars/jess-ainscough-claims-8216organic8217-cafe-misled-with-veggie-burger/story-fn93ypt9-1226668814935">repeats this bunk untramelled</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The holistic health coach, who was in Byron Bay last week, follows a strict organic diet after overcoming cancer without using modern medicine.</p></blockquote>

<p>She follows <a href="http://skepdic.com/gersontherapy.html">Gerson Therapy</a>, a debunked therapy that claims to be able to cure cancer by following a diet and &#8220;cleansing&#8221; unknown &#8220;toxins&#8221; from the body by coffee enemas. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerson_therapy#Gerson_Therapy">diet and enemas</a> are not proven to be effective in any <a href="http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/dietandnutrition/gerson-therapy">large scale peer reviewed studies</a>, and coffee enemas have been linked to the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/gerson/patient/Page2#Section_28">deaths of three people in the US</a>. Most notably, the advocates of these therapies often take over $10,000 a time from dying patients, telling them to <a href="https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theaustralian.com.au%2Fnews%2Ffeatures%2Fholding-out-for-a-miracle%2Fstory-e6frg8h6-1226476739168&amp;ei=p00KUoqiLMnwlAXdhIDwCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNHKviBCjXOnTlzqfpGUgo78qY3pOA&amp;sig2=MDGCuS_q5Zjj4x_uM45gKg&amp;bvm=bv.50500085,d.dGI">give up conventional treatments and pain medication</a> while they die. They are part of a growing number of natropaths encouraging people to die without conventional medicine, and they have a growing number of adherants:</p>

<blockquote><p>Last year Perth mother-of-four Gemma Bond staged her own public renunciation of conventional medicine after being diagnosed with ovarian and uterine cancer. After agreeing to a hysterectomy on her doctor&#8217;s recommendation, Bond declined all further treatment in favour of a regime of coffee enemas, ozone therapy, intravenous vitamins and supplements</p></blockquote>

<p>Last year there was an investigation by the West Australian government into the deaths of 20 cancer patients.</p>

<blockquote><p>Evelyn Vicker details how roughly 20 terminal cancer patients paid as much as $40,000 each to be subjected to an experimental treatment advertised on the internet and administered in Darwin and Perth in 2004-05. All of them were told to abandon conventional medical treatment, including painkillers; all were seduced by a claimed 95 per cent success rate; all of them died, many in agony.</p></blockquote>

<p>The coroner&#8217;s report recommended criminal proceedings against the doctor that <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-07-04/coroner-finds-against-alternative-cancer-therapy/4110182">promoted the therapy</a>, that include DMSO. The industrial solvent dimethyl sulfoxide is commonly claimed to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_sulfoxide">fake cancer cure</a>. The 281 page coroner&#8217;s report is <a href="http://www.safetyandquality.health.wa.gov.au/docs/mortality_review/inquest_finding/Operation_Lantana_finding.pdf">available online</a>, detailing how the patients died:</p>

<blockquote><p>Sartori lacked clinical skills and was unable to provide proper medical care while the treatment was occurring. Patients are at risk of suffering serious harm or dying due to the questionable clinical care received under his instruction. Those promoting the treatment claim it is “natural” and “safe”. Sartori’s form of this treatment is neither. It requires high doses of industrially manufactured substances and is manifestly unsafe, as are a number of other purportedly ‘natural’ products.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ainscough describes how her <a href="http://dolly.ninemsn.com.au/girltalk/realityreads/8399381/im-healing-myself-from-cancer-naturally">treatment supposedly works</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>This research led me to Gerson Therapy which ensures you have a perfectly balanced diet for optimum health, assisting your body to flush out nasties whilst feeding it with all the goodness it needs to flourish.</p>

<p>The therapy involves drinking 13 fresh organic veggie juices per day (yes that’s one an hour, every hour of my waking day), five coffee enemas per day and a basic organic whole food plant-based diet with additional supplements.</p></blockquote>

<p>There aren&#8217;t many jobs in which someone could have five or <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/florida-couple-addicted-coffee-enemas/story?id=18433235#.UchQKUE-cT8">more coffee enemas a day</a>. And while drinking juices may not be harmful, there is <a href="http://skepdic.com/gersontherapy.html">no evidence that the treatment works in the ways it says it does</a>, but is unfortunately continuing to exploit desperate people.</p>

<p>She goes on to invent &#8221;<a href="http://www.thewellnesswarrior.com.au/2013/06/how-your-thoughts-can-help-clean-up-the-planet/">psychic pollution</a>&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>Did you know that pollution on our planet is not only caused by greenhouse gases, littering and chemical waste but also by our negative thoughts?
Yes, you did read that last sentence correctly; our negative thoughts also contribute to pollution on our planet. This is called ‘psychic pollution.’
This fact has been proven: what we think and feel has a direct impact on the world around us.</p></blockquote>

</a>
<div class="video-info" >In the confines of a London dinner party, comedian Tim Minchin argues with a hippy named Storm. While Storm herself may not be converted, audiences from London to LA have been won over by Tim&#8217;s wordplay and the timely message of the film in a society where science and reason are portrayed as the enemy of belief.

Written and performed by Tim Minchin @timminchin. Directed by DC Turner @dcturner. Produced by Tracy King @tkingdoll. www.stormmovie.net
