<div class="entry-content"><p>When Tyler Clementi came out to his mother as gay in 2010 he wrote “Mom has basically completely rejected me.” Three weeks later, he jumped off a bridge to his death, after harassment from his college roommate. Jane Clementi has done serious soul searching after the death of her son, left her old evangelical church, and started campaigning <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/25/nyregion/after-tyler-clementis-suicide-his-parents-make-painful-changes-in-the-search-for-why.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;">for parents of gay teenagers to accept and love their children</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the months after Tyler’s death, some of Ms. Clementi’s friends confided that they, too, had gay children. She blames religion for the shame surrounding it — in the conversation about coming out, Tyler told his mother he did not think he could be Christian and gay.</p>

<p>“I think some people think that sexual orientation can be changed or prayed over,” she said now, in her kitchen. “But I know sexual orientation is not up for negotiation. I don’t think my children need to be changed. I think that what needed changing is attitudes, or myself, or maybe some other people I know.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Clementi has commented on the <a href="http://www.redletterchristians.org/care-reformation-project/">difficulty of some parents accepting same sex partners of their children</a></p>

<p>Mary Lou Wallner was taught by James Dobson of the Family Research Council that if a child announces that they are gay, the best thing to do is emotionally stonewall them until they renounce homosexuality. Wallner <a href="http://teach-ministries.org/">says</a> &#8220;I used to think that the only way to relate to gays was to confront them. I had no use for them. I didn&#8217;t understand them, and I was judgmental and arrogant.&#8221; When her daughter wrote her a letter announcing that she was comfortable in her sexuality as a lesbian woman, Wallner <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycbHnPhw8VQ">told her that she hated her sexuality and would never accept it</a>, tearing apart the relationship she had with her daughter. After her daughter committed suicide, Wallner reexamined some of the teachings she had received, and now campaigns for parents to accept gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, especially their own children.</p>

<p>The same tragic results have been seen <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/when-faith-and-sexuality-collide-20130413-2hskc.html">in Australia, when gay people are lead to believe that the God they believe in will never accept them</a>. Many Ex-Gay ministries encourage their participants to <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2012/07/24/577041/ex-gay-pornography/">look at pornography in order to &#8220;convince&#8221; themselves that they are straight</a>. In fact, some Victorian churches are so judgemental on the issue that they would rather condone prostitution and pornography than ever accept stable homosexual partnerships:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;I know of a church where one of the pastors recommended to a guy that he go and see a female prostitute because he couldn&#8217;t comprehend that this guy could not be attracted to or enjoy sex with a woman&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>While most of the ex-gay programs make grandiose claims about sexuality being a choice and being changeable, Alan Chambers, the president of Exodus International has admitted that <a href="http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/2010/03/04/20825">sexuality itself is unchangeable</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“The majority of people that I have met, and I would say the majority meaning 99.9% of them, have not experienced a change in their orientation or have gotten to a place where they could say that they could never be tempted or are not tempted in some way or experience some level of same-sex attraction.”</p></blockquote>

<p>While ex-gay groups deny that statement and the reality of <a href="http://www.exgaywatch.com/2011/07/exodus-says-ex-gay-boot-camps-dont-exist-survivors-say-otherwise/">psychological torture at extreme boot camps</a>, more and more evidence is showing the destructive nature of these programs. Ex gay ministries have tried to <a href="http://www.exgaywatch.com/2013/06/hardliners-pre-emptively-spin-expose-of-survivors-of-ex-gay-abuse/">spin reports on abusive programs</a> receiving heavy scrutiny. At the same time, many religious figures are owning up to the real problem of homophobia in their communities. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has stated that the church needs to acknowledge the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2013/aug/28/justin-welby-homophobia-anti-gay-prejudice">existence of homophobia in Church of England schools, and take steps to stamp it out</a>. Influential figures like Alan Chambers are admitting what these groups won&#8217;t, and has stated that the focus on <a href="http://exodusinternational.org/2013/06/i-am-sorry/">reducing homophobia within churches</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Recently, I have begun thinking again about how to apologize to the
people that have been hurt by Exodus International through an
experience or by a message. I have heard many firsthand stories from
people called ex-gay survivors. Stories of people who went to Exodus
affiliated ministries or ministers for help only to experience more
trauma. I have heard stories of shame, sexual misconduct, and false
hope. In every case that has been brought to my attention, there has
been swift action resulting in the removal of these leaders and/or
their organizations. But rarely was there an apology or a public
acknowledgement by me.</p>

<p>And then there is the trauma that I have caused. <strong>There were several
years that I conveniently omitted my ongoing same-sex attractions.</strong> I
was afraid to share them as readily and easily as I do today. They
brought me tremendous shame and I hid them in the hopes they would go
away. <strong>Looking back, it seems so odd that I thought I could do
something to make them stop. Today, however, I accept these feelings
as parts of my life that will likely always be there.</strong> The days of
feeling shame over being human in that way are long over, and I feel
free simply accepting myself as my wife and family does. As my friends
do. As God does.</p>

<p>Never in a million years would I intentionally hurt another person.
<strong>Yet, here I sit having hurt so many by failing to acknowledge the
pain some affiliated with Exodus International caused, and by failing
to share the whole truth about my own story. My good intentions matter
very little and fail to diminish the pain and hurt others have
experienced on my watch.</strong> The good that we have done at Exodus is
overshadowed by all of this.</p>

<p>Friends and critics alike have said it’s not enough to simply change
our message or website. I agree. I cannot simply move on and pretend
that I have always been the friend that I long to be today. <strong>I
understand why I am distrusted and why Exodus is hated.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Please know that I am deeply sorry. I am sorry for the pain and hurt
many of you have experienced. I am sorry that some of you spent years
working through the shame and guilt you felt when your attractions
didn’t change. I am sorry we promoted sexual orientation change
efforts and reparative theories about sexual orientation that
stigmatized parents. I am sorry that there were times I didn’t stand
up to people publicly “on my side” who called you names like
sodomite—or worse. I am sorry that I, knowing some of you so well,
failed to share publicly that the gay and lesbian people I know were
every bit as capable of being amazing parents as the straight people
that I know. I am sorry that when I celebrated a person coming to
Christ and surrendering their sexuality to Him that I callously
celebrated the end of relationships that broke your heart. I am sorry
that I have communicated that you and your families are less than me
and mine.</strong></p>

<p>More than anything, I am sorry that so many have interpreted this
religious rejection by Christians as God’s rejection. I am profoundly
sorry that many have walked away from their faith and that some have
chosen to end their lives. For the rest of my life I will proclaim
nothing but the whole truth of the Gospel, one of grace, mercy and
open invitation to all to enter into an inseverable relationship with
almighty God.</p>

<p>I cannot apologize for my deeply held biblical beliefs about the
boundaries I see in scripture surrounding sex, but I will exercise my
beliefs with great care and respect for those who do not share them. I
cannot apologize for my beliefs about marriage. <strong>But I do not have
any desire to fight you on your beliefs or the rights that you seek.
My beliefs about these things will never again interfere with God’s
command to love my neighbor as I love myself.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You have never been my enemy. I am very sorry that I have been
yours.</strong> I hope the changes in my own life, as well as the ones we
announce tonight regarding Exodus International, will bring
resolution, and show that I am serious in both my regret and my offer
of friendship. I pledge that future endeavors will be focused on peace
and common good.</p>

<p>Moving forward, we will serve in our pluralistic culture by hosting
thoughtful and safe conversations about gender and sexuality, while
partnering with others to reduce fear, inspire hope, and cultivate
human flourishing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Chamber&#8217;s statement is a move in the right direction. Hopefully Christian parents will understand how to change their views on homosexuality before their kids kill themselves. How many more kids need to die?</p>
