&#8220;I know of a church where one of the pastors recommended to a guy that he go and see a female prostitute because he couldn&#8217;t comprehend that this guy could not be attracted to or enjoy sex with a woman&#8221;</p>

<p>Chambers
http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/2010/03/04/20825“the majority of people that I have met, and I would say the majority meaning 99.9% of them, have not experienced a change in their orientation or have gotten to a place where they could say that they could never be tempted or are not tempted in some way or experience some level of same-sex attraction.”</p>

<p>In advance of the Exodus Freedom Conference in Irvine, California, and of
the airing of Lisa Ling’s <em>Our America</em> tomorrow night, in which he is
confronted by “ex-gay” survivors, Alan Chambers <a href="http://exodusinternational.org/2013/06/i-am-sorry/">has issued a long
apology</a> to the
LGBTQ community on Exodus’s website. While much more work obviously
remains to be done to make sure that Exodus is truly serious about never
again destroying the lives and families of LGBTQ people in the name of
faith, the apology is striking in that there is little to no
equivocation. I’m going to excerpt most of it, bolding parts that I feel
important, and we will have more commentary on this in the coming days:</p>

<blockquote><p>Recently, I have begun thinking again about how to apologize to the
people that have been hurt by Exodus International through an
experience or by a message. I have heard many firsthand stories from
people called ex-gay survivors. Stories of people who went to Exodus
affiliated ministries or ministers for help only to experience more
trauma. I have heard stories of shame, sexual misconduct, and false
hope. In every case that has been brought to my attention, there has
been swift action resulting in the removal of these leaders and/or
their organizations. But rarely was there an apology or a public
acknowledgement by me.</p>

<p>And then there is the trauma that I have caused. <strong>There were several
years that I conveniently omitted my ongoing same-sex attractions.</strong> I
was afraid to share them as readily and easily as I do today. They
brought me tremendous shame and I hid them in the hopes they would go
away. <strong>Looking back, it seems so odd that I thought I could do
something to make them stop. Today, however, I accept these feelings
as parts of my life that will likely always be there.</strong> The days of
feeling shame over being human in that way are long over, and I feel
free simply accepting myself as my wife and family does. As my friends
do. As God does.</p>

<p>Never in a million years would I intentionally hurt another person.
<strong>Yet, here I sit having hurt so many by failing to acknowledge the
pain some affiliated with Exodus International caused, and by failing
to share the whole truth about my own story. My good intentions matter
very little and fail to diminish the pain and hurt others have
experienced on my watch.</strong> The good that we have done at Exodus is
overshadowed by all of this.</p>

<p>Friends and critics alike have said it’s not enough to simply change
our message or website. I agree. I cannot simply move on and pretend
that I have always been the friend that I long to be today. <strong>I
understand why I am distrusted and why Exodus is hated.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Please know that I am deeply sorry. I am sorry for the pain and hurt
many of you have experienced. I am sorry that some of you spent years
working through the shame and guilt you felt when your attractions
didn’t change. I am sorry we promoted sexual orientation change
efforts and reparative theories about sexual orientation that
stigmatized parents. I am sorry that there were times I didn’t stand
up to people publicly “on my side” who called you names like
sodomite—or worse. I am sorry that I, knowing some of you so well,
failed to share publicly that the gay and lesbian people I know were
every bit as capable of being amazing parents as the straight people
that I know. I am sorry that when I celebrated a person coming to
Christ and surrendering their sexuality to Him that I callously
celebrated the end of relationships that broke your heart. I am sorry
that I have communicated that you and your families are less than me
and mine.</strong></p>

<p>More than anything, I am sorry that so many have interpreted this
religious rejection by Christians as God’s rejection. I am profoundly
sorry that many have walked away from their faith and that some have
chosen to end their lives. For the rest of my life I will proclaim
nothing but the whole truth of the Gospel, one of grace, mercy and
open invitation to all to enter into an inseverable relationship with
almighty God.</p>

<p>I cannot apologize for my deeply held biblical beliefs about the
boundaries I see in scripture surrounding sex, but I will exercise my
beliefs with great care and respect for those who do not share them. I
cannot apologize for my beliefs about marriage. <strong>But I do not have
any desire to fight you on your beliefs or the rights that you seek.
My beliefs about these things will never again interfere with God’s
command to love my neighbor as I love myself.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You have never been my enemy. I am very sorry that I have been
yours.</strong> I hope the changes in my own life, as well as the ones we
announce tonight regarding Exodus International, will bring
resolution, and show that I am serious in both my regret and my offer
of friendship. I pledge that future endeavors will be focused on peace
and common good.</p>

<p>Moving forward, we will serve in our pluralistic culture by hosting
thoughtful and safe conversations about gender and sexuality, while
partnering with others to reduce fear, inspire hope, and cultivate
human flourishing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Words are words, but words matter in that they are a start. We anxiously
await the announcements regarding Exodus’s future that Alan mentioned,
and we hope that Exodus’s “future” is that there won’t be one. That
would seem to be the only surefire way to stop the bleeding.</p>

<p>Lisa Ling’s special on Exodus airs tomorrow night at 10 EDT on the OWN
network.</p>
