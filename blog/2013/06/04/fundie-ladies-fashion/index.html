<div class="entry-content"><p>From <a href="http://www.stufffundieslike.com/2013/06/a-dress-code">Stuff Fundies Like</a>, the Victory Faith Bible KJV1611 Baptist Church Dress Code for Ladies’ (sic). Yes, there are a huge number of typo&#8217;s (couldn&#8217;t refuse). As the old quote attributed to <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Miriam_A._Ferguson">Miriam A. Ferguson</a> goes, &#8220;If the King&#8217;s English was good enough for Jesus Christ, it&#8217;s good enough for the children of Texas!&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><h4>That which pertaineth to a man</h4>

<p>Ladies’ must abstain from all appearance of evil. That means our ladies’ here at VFBKJV1611 Baptist Church should not where pants or shorts.</p></blockquote>

<p>When your church&#8217;s abbreviated name is a mouthfull, you know the commitee that designed it did a good job listening to every one of the paritioners&#8217;.</p>

<blockquote><h4>Tops</h4>

<p>Blouses and dresses must reach the colorbone and be buttoned all the way up. If the buttons gap open at the bust, ladies’ should go up a size or use safety pins to avoid having their <strong>braziers</strong> showing, which can be very tempting to our young men and therefore inappropriate. Blouses should be full and not darted, which means there should be no ungodly emphasis on the waistline or underbust. Arms should be no shorter than the elbow. Sheer materials should be avoidable, but if you must wear a sheer blouse, also wear a <strong>skin-collared brazier</strong> and a full slip to conceal <strong>you’re nakedness</strong>. Tee shirts, tank tops and other immodest tops are not acceptable.</p></blockquote>

<p>I need to add a new favourite Christian pick up line &#8220;Your brazier gets my brazier going.&#8221; A great one to slip in after &#8220;nice bible&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;ve been reading Numbers and I realised I don&#8217;t have yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>By way of explanation: Bra is short for Brassiere, pronounced &#8220;/brəˈzɪər/&#8221; in the US, leading to word completion suggesting &#8220;brazier.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><h4>Skirts</h4>

<p>Skirts should be at least 3 inches below the knee so that you can sit, kneel and otherwise move around without expositing your knee. Your skirt should also be at least a-line and preferably circle or very full to avoid drawring unnecessary attention to your legs. The waist should hit at your natural waist (low waistts are not acceptable) and be gathered to avoid unnecessary attention to the hips. Your skirt should have no slits. Kick pleats should not be necessary if your skirt is properly full. All <strong>ladies’ should where a slip</strong> with their skirts to avoid immodest exposure that could lead to lustful thoughts.</p></blockquote>

<p>Girls, why stop at the knee length skirts? Why not go to a <a href="http://thefbomb.org/2009/11/corduroy-skirts-are-a-sin/">full length corduroy skirt</a>?</p>

<p><img src="/images/corduroy.jpg" alt="Corduroy Skirts are a Sin" /></p>

<blockquote><h4>Culottes</h4>

<p>Box pleat culottes are required for outdoors activities, but <strong>we ask that our ladies’ not where them to services</strong>. Culottes should follow the same rules as skirts and reach at least 3 inches below the knee and be sufficiently full that <strong>we do not see the shape of your legs</strong>. Also, if you canot do it modestly in culottes, you should rethink doing it at all. It may just <strong>not be a ladylike actvitiy</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>And if your daughter starts looking too butch, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyKw4yKfWOU">tell her off</a></p>

<blockquote><h4>Legs</h4>

<p>We know you have them. We do not want to see them. Please wear nylons or tights to conceal the flesh of your legs. Closed-toed shows are not mandatory, but we do ask our ladies’ to consider the fleshly desires of our gentlemen and dress accordingly. Heels that excessively “bunch up” the calf are nightclub attire, not church attire. Bobby socks and canvas tennis shoes are acceptable for certain functions. Please ask Mrs. Pastor for more information.</p></blockquote>

<p>And so the ladies&#8217; all know that the other ladies&#8217; have legs, which the men never, ever see.</p>

<blockquote><h4>Hair</h4>

<p>The KJV1611 says long hair is a glory. We request that our ladies’ <strong>discuss their hair with their husbands or fathers</strong> to determine the most appropriate hair length for godly glory. Hair should be a natural color (no red, pink or blue, please!) and cut in a flattering, modest manner that does not bring undue attention to our godly ladies heads.</p></blockquote>

<p>What the hell is a woman&#8217;s father doing giving you fashion advice? What would a man know about hair other than &#8220;I&#8217;m sure it looks <strong><em>fine</em></strong>.&#8221; At least they&#8217;re not asking <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2012/06/27/the-ugly-side-of-modesty/">grandpa for advice</a>.</p>

<blockquote><h4>Makeup and jewelry</h4>

<p>Ladies, if the barn needs painting, paint it, but <strong>avoid whoriehs excessiveness</strong>. Lipstick should be natural-colored, and leave the false eyelashes at home! Jewelry should be limited to (one) wedding ring and (one) engagement rink. GOD Himself tells us that peircings are a sign of slaves, not godly women, so skip them!</p></blockquote>

<p>Most any modern Christian would interpret biblical references to slavery as part of a bygone era. <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/lovejoyfeminism/2013/03/doug-wilsons-race-problem.html">Not so in the wonky world of parochial Southern Christianity</a></p>

<blockquote><h4>Bodies</h4>

<p>We understand that ladies come in all shapes and sizes. That said, ladies who are thin should consider the effect of their vanity on their soles. Ladies who are bigger need to <strong>worry about their husbands’ soles and maybe lose some weight</strong> so their husbands are not tempted to stray. The rest of you ladies need to wear looser-fitting clothes to conceal your hips and other lady areas. We recommend jumpers since these offer the best coverage of (we apologize for our course language) curves.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yeah your husband&#8217;s shoes will wear out if he insists on <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2013/03/15/christian-pastor-i-carry-my-wife-around-the-house-every-day-to-show-her-whos-boss/">carrying you around the house to show you who&#8217;s boss</a></p>

<blockquote><h4>Other</h4>

<p>Any other concerns not already mentioned can be discussed with our godly pastor or any of the deacons, who would be happy to set up a private appointment to discuss your modesty needs or <strong>evaluate a particular outfit</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Something tells me most of these evaluations are not initated by the women themselves.</p>

<blockquote><h4>Visitors</h4>

<p>We understand that nonmebers may arrive wearing inappropriate clothing. Although we are always happy to welcome new people, we do feel it is important to emphasize modesty to protect our men from lustful thoughts. If you notice a visitor lady who is wearing a tight skirt, pants or a low-cut blouse, please let her know we love her as a sister, and <strong>offer her one of our spare sweaters</strong> (they are located in the church foyer’s coat rack) to wear over her top or place over her bottom half while she is sitting.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, because nothing will make a young woman in normal, socially acceptable knee length shorts feel comfortable than being told she has to put a borrowed sweater over her legs in a condescending &#8220;we just want the best for you&#8221; manner.</p>

<blockquote><p>We appreciate all our sisters’ in Christ taking the time to keep our church modest! Let us know if there is any way we can support you in this endeavor. </p>

<p>Please sign and date this document to signify your agreement to the dress code.</p></blockquote>

<p>The best part is many right wing Independent Fundamentalist Baptist churches support the <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/English-only_movement">English Only movement</a> and are opposed to immigration reform. Just have a look at some of the &#8221;<a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/teabonics-ridiculous-misspelled-tea-party-protest-signs-gallery-1.1918">Teabonics</a>&#8221; on <a href="http://politicalhumor.about.com/od/funnypictures/ig/Funny-Protest-Signs/">these protest signs</a>:</p>
