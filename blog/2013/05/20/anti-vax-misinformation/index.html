<div class="entry-content"><p>According to a new study, reported in The Age, <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/national/health/worry-grows-over-safety-of-childhood-jabs-20130519-2juvt.html">53% of Australian parents have concerns about vaccinating their children</a>.</p>

<p>The NSW opposition is considering allowing childcare centres <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-19/push-to-ban-unvaccinated-children-from-nsw-preschools/4698786">ban unvaccinated individuals</a>. The opposition states that immunisation rates are lower than in Rwanda and Iran. Looking the stats up, it&#8217;s true. <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.IMM.MEAS/countries">WHO data on measels immunisation</a> show that 94% of Australian children are immunised, compared to 99% in Iran and 95% in Rwanda. <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.IMM.IDPT/countries">WHO data on Diptheria, Pertussis and Tetanus immunisation</a> shows 92% of Australian children are immunised, compared to 99% in Iran and 97% in Rwanda. <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/political-news/rwanda-trounces-australia-at-immunisation-20130529-2nc5n.html">Eritrea and Bangladesh also have higher immunisation rates</a></p>

<p>There were <a href="http://www0.health.nsw.gov.au/data/diseases/measles.asp">172 cases of measles in NSW in 2012</a>, <a href="http://www.wahs.nsw.gov.au/news/2012/20121004_00.html">requiring the opening of new health centres to distribute the Mesles, Mumps and Rubella vaccine</a>. Rubella is rare, with less than <a href="http://www0.health.nsw.gov.au/data/diseases/rubella.asp">6 new notifications</a> a month, Mumps spiked to <a href="http://www0.health.nsw.gov.au/data/diseases/mumps.asp">24 cases in June 2012</a>. Pertussis (Whooping Cough) has trended downwards from around 2,000 new cases being reported in January 2009 to <a href="http://www0.health.nsw.gov.au/data/diseases/pertussis.asp">less than 200 new cases a month in 2013</a>. Lack of concern about diseases like Whooping Cough may be a byproduct of good public health measures to prevent curtail the disease.</p>

<p>Data from Medicare show that NSW and WA have <a href="http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/provider/patients/acir/statistics.jsp">the lowest immunisation rates</a> with 89.3% of WA children 60-63 months of age. There are communities with less than <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-04-11/children-across-australia-not-fully-imunised/4622666">85% of children vaccinated, with 77,000 not fully immunised nationally</a>. Pockets in <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-03-20/anti-vaccination-campaigns-threaten-measles-free-status/4584514">northern NSW and southern QLD are at greatest risk</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Dr MacIntyre says some parts of Australia have a greater risk of a measles outbreak because of lower immunisation rates, such as northern New South Wales and southern Queensland.</p>

<p>Australian Medical Association (AMA) president Steve Hambleton says it is those areas which threaten Australia&#8217;s position.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our [measles] elimination status is under threat because there are pockets of decreasing immunisation of our children,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some affluent areas in Sydney also have <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-04-11/low-immunisation-rates-in-affluent-sydney/4622634">lower immunisation rates</a>
Unfortunately fear campaigns like Meryl Dorey&#8217;s Australian Vaccination Network have scared a small number (2%) of parents into rejecting vaccines, and a large proportion of parents feel a concern. Around 8% of parents don&#8217;t fully vaccinate their children, and would benefit from a public health campaign that listens to their concerns and tries to address them.</p>

<p>NSW Health minister Tanya Plibersek has launched a booklet &#8220;Immunisation Myths And Realities&#8221; and advised parents &#8221;<a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/dr-google-cant-be-trusted-with-childs-health/story-e6frg6n6-1226650596663">Dr Google has been a negative influence</a>&#8221;. My opinion is that NSW Health and the AMA should be more proactive in online media, taking out ads on search results for searches like &#8216;vaccination&#8217; to make sure that correct information comes up before the AVN&#8217;s fearmongering, as while &#8220;Dr Google&#8221; may be prone to misinformation, the reality is that more and more parents will turn to it.</p>

<p>In the past it was possible to tell parents &#8220;just trust your GP and do what they say&#8221;. It may be more helpful, in future, to ensure that GPs listen to their patients to maintain high levels of trust in the public health system in an era of consumer focussed medicine and online misinformation campaigns.</p>
