<div class="youtube-lazy-link-info">Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on the Bible, same sex marriage, slavery, discrimination</div>
</a>
<div class="video-info" >The day after PM Kevin Rudd&#8217;s comments on Q&A to a Christian pastor, about same sex marriage and saying that the Bible sees slavery as &#8216;a natural condition&#8217;.

12:30pm, 3 September 2013, Tasmania-

Reporter: Just on your exchange last night with a Christian pastor about same-sex marriage, are you concerned your position on marriage equality risks alienating the Christian vote?

Kevin Rudd: You know something? This is a really interesting example of a question, because it&#8217;s about political perceptions of a given action. I&#8217;m concerned about what we do. I&#8217;m actually concerned about answering directly a question about what we do about all those Australians who are in same-sex relationships, who are asking for a basic exercise of human decency which is called &#8216;marriage equality&#8217;. And so, if it offends some people, so be it. But my job is to say what I am standing up for, what we would do if we are re-elected, and how we would go about doing it. And I&#8217;ve done that. And in my response to that fellow last night, when people start hurling Biblical quotes at me &#8211; I know a bit about my New Testament as well. And as I said last night, if you&#8217;re going to be a serious Biblicist about these questions, we&#8217;d still be supporting slavery in the 21st century, and by the way, to all of you who are women, it says in the New Testament according to St Paul that wives should be submissive to their husbands. So just bear all that in mind, cause it&#8217;s in the Bible. In fact, if we took it that seriously, you know what? We may as well repeal, also, the Sex Discrimination Act because that creates a different set of circumstances. Let&#8217;s get real about this. The core principles are those I outlined last night. And what happens with any civilised country is over time, they apply them to different sets of circumstances. And we did that in the 19th century with slavery, we did that in the 20th century &#8211; far too late &#8211; in terms of the rights of women. 21st century &#8211; we should look at the rights of same-sex couples. These are questions of principle. And therefore they should be addressed firmly as such. And as to their political consequences, that&#8217;s a matter for others. I&#8217;m there to argue a proposition and my reasons for it. I think I did it fairly clearly last night.</div>
</div>


<p>The religious community, of course, is furious that their authority to oppose legislation the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-08-29/vote-compass-gay-marriage-euthanasia-abortion/4918494">majority of Australians want</a> is questioned by the issue of the relevance of the bible to contemporary society. Sandy Grant has trotted out the tired evangelical claim that the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-03/grant-how-could-a-christian-pm-call-the-bible-pro-slavery/4932422">bible doesn&#8217;t endorse slavery</a> even though it&#8217;s been interpreted that way for most of human history. Grant claims &#8220;Even a cursory reading of the Bible would tell you it never says slavery is a &#8220;natural condition&#8221;. Never. Not once.&#8221; Of course, the Curse of Caanan, commonly called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_Ham">Curse of Ham</a> in Genesis 9 says that some races deserve to be the &#8220;least of the slaves&#8221; to the others:</p>

<blockquote><p> Noah, a man of the soil, began to plant a vineyard. <em>21</em> When he drank some of the wine, he got drunk and uncovered himself inside his tent. <em>22</em> Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father&#8217;s nakedness and told his two brothers who were outside. <em>23</em> Shem and Japheth took the garment and placed it on their shoulders. Then they walked in backwards and covered up their father&#8217;s nakedness. Their faces were turned the other way so they did not see their father&#8217;s nakedness.</p>

<p> 24 When Noah awoke from his drunken stupor he learned what his youngest son had done to him. 25 So he said,</p>

<p> &#8220;Cursed be Canaan!<br/>
 The <strong>lowest of slaves</strong><br/>
 he will be to his brothers.&#8221; <br/>
 26 He also said,</p>

<p> &#8220;Worthy of praise is the LORD, the God of Shem! <br/>
 May Canaan be the slave of Shem!<br/>
 27 May God enlarge Japheth&#8217;s territory and numbers!<br/>
 May he live in the tents of Shem <br/>
 and may Canaan be his slave!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>And so because Ham didn&#8217;t cover up his father&#8217;s nakedness, instead left his father&#8217;s tent to tell his brothers and laugh at his father (and possibly bring out Noah&#8217;s garment to show his brothers, before they honourably bring back &#8220;the garment&#8221;) all of Ham&#8217;s descendants are cursed to be the lowest of slaves (<strong>עֶבֶד עֲבָדִים eved avadim</strong>). The curse is pronounced on Canaan, not Ham.</p>

<p>While Genesis 9 only mentiones the Canaanites (Phoenecia/Palestine) as the people group under the curse of slavery from Ham, Genesis 10:6 also mentions the Cush (Nubia/Ethiopia), Mizraim (Egypt) and Put (Libya). Traditional Christian understanding asserts that Japheth went on to father the people group that became Western Europeans and Caucasians. Biblical literallists have used this understanding of Genesis for generations to support the idea that black people were under a curse from God to serve the white people as slaves. Unfortunately the idea humans come from Noah&#8217;s family <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/texas-public-school-course-teaches-racial-origins-traced-noah">still being taught by creationists in Texan public schools</a>.</p>

<p>Grant admits that the bible regulates slavery, but notes &#8220;it is true that the Bible also honestly records, and sometimes regulates, the practice of slavery. It is naïve in the extreme - just a poor reading strategy - to assume an endorsement&#8230; because it is regulated.&#8221; Of course, with modern apologetics, Grant can construct all kinds of fancy arguments about how &#8220;recording&#8221; and &#8220;regulating&#8221; slavery is not an endorsement, but that was never the way that <a href="http://www.lva.virginia.gov/lib-edu/education/psd/nation/halifax.htm">slave owners saw things in 1785</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>An Attempt carried on by the Enemies of our Country, Tools of the British Administration, and supported by a Number of deluded Men among us, to <strong>wrest from us our Slaves</strong> by an act of the Legislature for a general Emancipation of them&#8230; But is unsupported by the Word of God, and will be ruinous to Individuals and to the Public.</p>

<p>It is unsupported by the Word of God. Under the Old Testament Dispensation, Slavery was permitted by the Deity himself. Thus it is recorded, in Levit. Chap. 25. Ver. 44, 45, 46. &#8216;Both they Bond-men, and Bond-maids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the Heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy Bond-men and Bond-maids. Moreover, of the Children of the Strangers, that do sojourn among you of them shall ye buy, and of their Families that are with you, which they beget in your Land, and they shall be your Possession, and ye shall take them, as an Inheritance for your Children after you, to inherit them for a Possession; they shall be your Bond-men forever.&#8217; This <strong>Permission to possess and inherit Bond Servants</strong>, we have Reason to conclude, was continued through all the Revolutions of the Jewish Government, down to the Advent of our Lord. And we do not find, that either he or his Apostles abridged it. On the Contrary, the Freedom which the Followers of Jesus were taught to expect, was a Freedom from the Bondage of Sin and Satan, and from the Dominion of their Lusts and Passions; but as to their outward Condition, whatever that was, wether Bond or Free, when they embraced Christianity, it was to remain the same afterwards. This Saint Paul hath expressly told us 1 Cor. Chap. 7. Ver. 20th. where he is speaking directly to this very Point; &#8216;Let every Man abide in the same Calling, wherein he is called&#8217;; and at Ver. 24. &#8216;Let every Man wherein he is called therein abide with God.&#8217; Thus it is evident the above Attempt is unsupported by the Divine Word.</p></blockquote>

<p>Critically, Grant implies that there is such a clear difference between endoresment and regulation that it would be obvious to an informed reader which is which. In reality, proslavery apologists like James Henley Thornwell would simply present the <a href="http://rachelheldevans.com/blog/is-abolition-biblical">&#8220;plain reading&#8221; of scripture</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;On the eve of the Civil War, interpretations of the Bible that made the most sense to the broadest public were those that incorporated the defining experiences of America into the hermeneutics used for interpreting what the infallible text actually meant. In this effort, those who like James Henley Thornwell defended the legitimacy of slavery in the Bible had the easiest task. The procedure, which by 1860 had been repeated countless times, was uncomplicated. First, open the Scriptures and read, at say Leviticus 25:45, or, even better, at 1 Corinthians 7:20-21. Second, decide for yourself what these passages mean. Don’t wait for a bishop or a king or a president or a meddling Yankee to tell you what the passage means, but decide for yourself. Third, if anyone tries to convince  you that you are not interpreting such passages in the natural, commonsensical, ordinary meaning of the words, look hard at what such a one believes with respect to other biblical doctrines. If you find in what he or she says about such doctrines the least hint of unorthodoxy, as inevitably you will, then you may rest assured that you are being asked to give up not only the plain meaning of Scripture, but also the entire trust in the Bible that made the country into such a great Christian civilization.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>By defending what he claimed was the &#8220;plain&#8221; reading of scripture, Thornwell could then oppose supporters of abolitionism by accusing them of attacking Christianity. In a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Henley_Thornwell">speech, he stated</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The parties in this conflict are not merely abolitionists and slaveholders—they are atheists, socialists, communists, red republicans, jacobins, on one side, and the friends of order and regulated freedom on the other. In one word, the world is the battleground—Christianity and Atheism the combatants; and the progress of humanity at stake</p></blockquote>

<p>Grant states that &#8220;Any material regulating the practice of slavery needs to be read alongside the extensive material which shows the Bible ultimately opposes slavery.&#8221; By that maxim, any material that appears to offer exculpatory evidence must also be read alongside other material that refutes it. For instance, Grant claims that Yahweh&#8217;s freeing of the Israelite people from captivity proves that he doesn&#8217;t like slavery:</p>

<blockquote><p>It involves God&#8217;s rescue of his people out of slavery! Slavery is presented as unequivocally unpleasant and cruel. Refer Exodus 2:23-25:</p>

<p>During that long period, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out, and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to God. God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob. So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them. (NIV84)</p></blockquote>

<p>What Grant conveniently ignores is that during the Exodus, the Israelite people had already been given the dominion over other races back in Genesis 17: 12-13, with Abraham owning Hagar, a slave girl from Egypt. The narrative has the Israelites escaping from Egypt and immediately being given permission to give passover to their own slaves, in Exodus 12: (ESV)</p>

<blockquote><p>43 And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the statute of the Passover: no foreigner shall eat of it, 44 but every slave that is bought for money may eat of it after you have circumcised him.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yahweh goes on in Exodus 20 to give clear commands</p>

<ul>
<li>You shall not murder.</li>
<li>You shall not commit adultery.</li>
<li>You shall not steal.</li>
<li>You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.</li>
</ul>


<p>But the final commandment is &#8220;You shall not covet your neighbor&#8217;s house. You shall not covet your neighbor&#8217;s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that belongs to your neighbor.&#8221; If god wanted to lay down a clear, unequivocal law against keeping slaves, he could easily do so like with murder, adultery, stealing and lying. Instead he categorises humans as property, like wives treated as chattel.</p>

<p>Grant claims that 1 Timothy 1 opposes the slave trade, but neglects to mention that the first slave ship to bring Africans to America was called &#8221;<a href="http://graceinafrica.com/the-good-ship-jesus/">The Good Ship Jesus</a>&#8221;:</p>

<blockquote><p>A deeply religious gentleman, Hawkins insisted that his crew “serve God daily” and “love another” as he sailed his ship for Africa.  In a short time he had gathered up over 300 Africans “partly by sword and partly by other means.”  The other means included promising them free land and riches in the new world.</p></blockquote>

<p>If Yahweh wanted to give a clear prohibition he could do that.
Grant notes that Ephesians 6 &#8220;counter-culturally warns masters never to mistreat their slaves.&#8221; Of course, he fails to note that by a similar standard, 1 Corinthians 6:16-18 counter-culturally condemns prostitution clearly and unequivocally with no concession to the economic and cultural situation of the time, when to Corinthianise meant to fornicate.</p>

<p>Grant claims that &#8220;Paul encourages the emancipation of a runaway slave, Onesimus, in his letter to the wronged-master, Philemon.&#8221; He doesn&#8217;t note that the slave was sent back, and the note encouraged the slavemaster to seek dues from Paul. But Paul asserts the right for slavemasters to have their human propertyreturned, while he only argues for the emancipation of one slave, and the way in which future slavemasters would interpret how to deal with runaway slaves is left up to the circumstances.</p>

<p>Many other articles counter the idea that the <a href="http://www.skepticink.com/reasonablyfaithless/2013/02/07/slavery-bible-style/">bible is overwhelmingly against slavery</a>, or that Christians thoughout history have been <a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com.au/2010/07/slave-to-incompetence-truth-behind.html">overwhelmingly on the side of abolitionism</a>.</p>

<p>Justin Welby, on launching a campaign to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/07/05/homophobic-bullying-campaign-coe_n_3551701.html">stamp out anti-gay bullying in Anglican schools</a> noted &#8220;The majority of the population rightly detests homophobic behaviour or anything that looks like it and sometimes they look at us and see what they don&#8217;t like.&#8221; He followed up talking about his vote against marriage equality in the UK parliament, <a href="http://www.secularism.org.uk/blog/2013/08/on-homophobia-and-racism">noting</a></p>

<blockquote><p>We have seen changes in the idea about sexuality, sexual behaviour. We have to face the fact that the vast majority of people under 35 not only think that what we&#8217;re saying is incomprehensible but also think that we&#8217;re plain wrong and wicked and equate it to racism and other forms of gross and atrocious injustice. We have to be real about that.</p></blockquote>

<p>The question evangelicals now need to answer is, how would you like to be remembered by your kids? As someone who changed with the times, or someone who kept holding onto views that became increasingly despised?</p>
