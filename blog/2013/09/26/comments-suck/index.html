<div class="entry-content"><p>Popular Science recently announced that they are shutting down the comments for new articles, as they can skew the readers into <a href="http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2013-09/why-were-shutting-our-comments">distrusting the expertise of scientists</a>. Recent studies have found that incivility in the comment section can alter the perception of the credibility of the articles they accompany. In one study, readers of a fake blog post on nanotechnology were asked to evaluate it&#8217;s impact, with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/opinion/sunday/this-story-stinks.html?_r=0">one group exposed to vituperative comments</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p> Uncivil comments not only polarized readers, but they often changed a participant&#8217;s interpretation of the news story itself.<br/>
 In the civil group, those who initially did or did not support the technology — whom we identified with preliminary survey questions — continued to feel the same way after reading the comments. Those exposed to rude comments, however, ended up with a much more polarized understanding of the risks connected with the technology.<br/>
 Simply including an ad hominem attack in a reader comment was enough to make study participants think the downside of the reported technology was greater than they&#8217;d previously thought.</p></blockquote>

<p>In a world where more and more discussion of contemporary issues happens online, this does not bode well for the public understanding of the importance of science, alread <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/opinion/welcome-to-the-age-of-denial.html">at all time lows</a>. As people search out information about health online, &#8220;Dr Google&#8221; can mislead patients and present <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/bigideas/stories/2011/04/28/3202794.htm">debunked information wrongly suggesting that vaccines don&#8217;t work</a>. A decentralised media landscape should have the ability to route around authoritarian regimes that try to censor it, but what happens when it undermines the structures that support the public respect of useful institutions?</p>

<p>Carl Sagan fundamentaly believed that the populace deserved to be educated about science, so that political or religious charlatans wouldn&#8217;t lure them into the next deception. Noting that either the people control the government or the government controls the people, he fiercely advocated that the science of evolution be taught in public schools so that the people could choose to understand science for themselves:</p>

<p>Benkler, in his 2006 book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Networks">The Wealth of Networks</a> portended a networked society enriched by freely available peer-produced cultural works in a shared online commons like wikipedia. The utipian visions of such an information ecosystem, however, have to be reconciled with the reality that most people are unaware of their own cognitive biases, and are increasingly polarised on science and other issues in the management of polities. Without educating people on cognative biases and getting them to understand the world as it is, not as they want it to be, then potentially a decentrilised internet will simply fracture people into tribal teams who all see things the same way. Unfortunately, some content algorithms are set up to give users content <a href="http://www.thefilterbubble.com/ted-talk">similar to what they&#8217;ve already seen</a> potentially limiting their exposure to information that contradicts their beliefs. Similarly, asking a search engine to find information on &#8220;global warming <em>science</em>&#8221; or &#8220;global warming <em>conspiracy</em>&#8221; may find different sets of sites, without the questioner perceiving any bias in their own question, and assuming that the results they see are representitive of the information as a whole.</p>

<p>In conclusion to all of this, the reason I don&#8217;t have comments is that like Popular Science, I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re particularly helpful.</p>
