<p>Everyone knows the old rule of avoiding bringing up religion and politics in polite company to keep discussions civil. Political disagreements often become pointed and vituperative because people who are otherwise open to new ideas can become defensive when their political views are questioned. While most people believe that others will see things their way if they simply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_deficit_model">had the right information</a>, the reality is that people presented with new information will typically interpret in light of what they already know. A new study from Yale shows just how bad the problem can be, with people <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/09/new-study-politics-makes-you-innumerate">letting their political views get in the way of thinking clearly</a>.</p>

<p>Dan Kahan presented students with a simple number problem, asking them to determine whether a certain intervention improves or worsens a problem. Respondents were presented with one version asking about skin rashes (a neutral problem) and another version asking them about gun control and crime (a deeply polarising ongoing political argument). The respondents were presented with the following table and asked whether the intervention worked:</p>

<p><img src="/images/Kahan1.png"></p>

<p>Figuring out whether the cream works requires computing two ratios, and comparing whether the intervention worked better in the experimental group than the control group. In the experimental group, there is a 3:1 ratio of improvement to worsening, leading to the intuitive answer that the intervention works. But the correct answer is only found when that ratio is compared to the 5:1 improvement in the control group. As I&#8217;ve already written about, people can <a href="/blog/2013/06/12/are-you-a-racist/">make errors in basic maths problems by settling for the intuitive answer</a>, rather than double checking their work to find the correct one.</p>

<p>On average only 41% of respondents got the answer about skin care right, with more numerate respondents getting the answer right more of the time. Unfortunately, with the question on gun control, highly numerate Democrats and Republicans tended to get the answer right when the intuitive answer didn&#8217;t align with their political philosophy, but were unlikely to get the answer right when the intuitive answer agreed with their political philosophy. Kahan&#8217;s data suggests that people with high scientific literacy and numeracy are still likely to misinterpret scientific findings if they agree or disagree with their political biases. Earlier work found that people with a high level of scientific literacy, on average, are <a href="http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v2/n10/full/nclimate1547.html">more sceptical of climate change</a>, with views more politically polarised the more knowledgeable the individuals are.</p>

<p>When people are presented with information on the risks and opportunities of nanotechnology, those who oppose nuclear power usually oppose nanotechnology, and vice versa, as people interpret new information in line with their pre-existing beliefs. Philosophers and moral leaders have for millennia used parables and metaphors to present new ideas to students, getting them to reason about thought experiments outside of their intuitions about their current situation.</p>

<p>David Hume described reason as the &#8220;slave of the passions&#8221;, and Jonathan Haidt describes human cognition as an emotional elephant with a rational rider. We think with emotions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory#Dual-process_accounts_of_reasoning">faster than we consciously reason with logic</a>. More often than not, the reasons we give for thinking one way or another are post-hoc rationalisations for intuitive emotional judgements. Haidt has suggested that many people see themselves in a tribe, with their own interests in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realistic_conflict_theory">opposition to the other team&#8217;s</a>. People who support certain causes can see their identity as part of a group that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_cognition">believes in similar causes</a>.</p>

<p>So while many people view the divisiveness of political discourse as the fault of the current media landscape, the reality is that these kinds of debates have been going on for all of history. In Emperor Justinius&#8217;s Byzantium in 532, political factions took sides on chariot racing in the Hippodrome. Two major factions existed, the Blues and Greens racing teams, with the Blues receiving support from the Emperor and his faction, and the Greens a more popular team. Consider the historian Procopius&#8217;s view on the <a href="http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/procop-wars1.asp">politics of Byzantium in 532</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In every city the population has been divided for a long time past into the Blue and the Green factions; but within comparatively recent times it has come about that, for the sake of these names and the seats which the rival factions occupy in watching the games, they spend their money and abandon their bodies to the most cruel tortures, and even do not think it unworthy to die a most shameful death. And they fight against their opponents knowing not for what end they imperil themselves, but knowing well that, even if they overcome their enemy the fight, the conclusion of the matter for them will be to be carried off straight away to the prison, and finally, after suffering extreme torture, to be destroyed. So there grows up in them against their fellow men a hostility which has no cause, and at no time does it cease or disappear, for it gives place neither to the ties of marriage nor of relationship nor of friendship, and the case is the same even though those who differ with respect to these colours be brothers or any other kin</p></blockquote>

<p><img src="/images/Ben-Hur.jpg" title="Chariot Racing, from Ben Hur" ></p>

<p>The horse races could kill and maim participants, and some of the supporters, in their colours would smuggle weapons into the stadium (that seated 150,000) to start fights with the supporters of the other team. These fights broke out not just because of the sport, but because the tribal identity of the sports teams lead their supporters to fight over political issues, and theological debates coming from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcedonian_Christianity">Fourth Ecumenical council</a>. This culminated in a riot that Procopius estimated <a href="http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/history/2012/03/blue-versus-green-rocking-the-byzantine-empire/">killed up to 30,000</a></p>

<p>Eliazar Yudkowsky has reflected on just how meaningless and pointless these tribal conflicts can be. In a <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/gt/a_fable_of_science_and_politics/">thought experiment I love</a>, he presents a politicised version of Plato&#8217;s cave, inviting reflection on a future society living underground with no vision of the sky. They have only scraps of human history describing a &#8220;cerulean&#8221; sky, and factions of Blues and Greens have fought violently for years over the interpretation of the colour of the sky. After growing exhausted with the constant conflicts over the issue, an uneasy truce develops. People continue to be entrenched into the &#8220;Blue&#8221; or &#8220;Green&#8221; way of thinking about political and cultural issues like taxation, based on battle lines drawn from the original debate.</p>

<p>I highly recommend reading Yudkowsky&#8217;s post in full to understand the power of the metaphor. Briefly, he presents different people reaching the surface and seeing the sky for the first time. For some Blues, the confirmation of a blue sky encourages them to want to break the truce and fight out the issue. For some Greens, the disconfirmation of everything they&#8217;ve lived for crushes them, and they must confront the cruel truth that while the reviled Blues are right. For the professor who&#8217;s always emphasised that both positions could be right, the single colour of the sky is too much of a risk to the harmony of society to embrace. For one Green, the admission that she was wrong for most of her life will hurt her family and leave her with few friends, but her committment to intellectual integrity requires her to announce her changed belief. The final traveller, seeing only the beauty and wonder of the sky, marvels at the new environment and decides to go exploring.</p>

<p>Knowing that political differences arise from the way that people deal with information, rather than a lack of information, leads me to belive that the last traveller probably has the best response. Sometimes you&#8217;ll find new information that other people wouldn&#8217;t accept, and it&#8217;s better just to explore the world without them.</p>
