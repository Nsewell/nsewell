<div class="entry-content">Consider this, you live next to a man who you know is raping his daughter. Do you intervene? Do you care about that man&#8217;s right to privacy, or his desire to be left alone to his own devices? Now think about this: if you were God, would you intervene? Would you violate the rapist&#8217;s free will to protect the child? If you would, why wouldn&#8217;t God?

William Lane Craig defines God [in this way](http://www.skepticink.com/reasonablyfaithless/2013/01/01/arguing-about-ontology/): “God is, by definition, the greatest being conceivable.” If God is the greatest being conceivable, can you conceive of a God better than Yahweh? Can you imagine a god that intervenes in the abduction, rape and enslavement of three women for 9 years? Can you imagine a god that doesn&#8217;t endorse [sex slavery](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deut21.10-14&version=NET) or the [enslavement of 32,000 virgins for the enjoyment of his Israelite soldiers, treating them like chattel](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=num31&version=NET)? Can you imagine a god that doesn&#8217;t [order the slaughter of Amalekite men, women and children](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/may/30/christian-fundamentalists-plan-teach-genocide) (often taught as a [lesson in *complete* obedience](https://intrinsicdignity.wordpress.com/2010/04/19/good-news-club-on-the-slaughter-of-the-amalekites/))? If you can imagine any of these things, then well done, the Mariconite god is the one true God. 

What if you don&#8217;t like Paul&#8217;s views on [slaves](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1pet2.18;tit2.9;eph6.5-8&version=NET) [women](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph5.22-24&version=NET) or [gays](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1ti1.8-10;1cor6.9-10;rom1.18-32&version=NET)? Well, start your own faith tradition to worship your own interpretation of the Chirstian god. There are between [38,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian#Demographics) and [41,000 Christian denominations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_denominations), more than the [33,829 sentences in the KJV](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=number%20of%20sentences%20in%20the%20bible). Some of these denominations are the same movement in different countries, but the figures show a remarkable diversity of opinion not just on liturgy but on scripture and theology, and many differences on soteriology.

Protestants maintain that the only thing necessary for belief is scripture alone ([Sola Scriptura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_scriptura)).
If Protestantism is true, and a key part of Protestant Christian experience is reading the bible, why
did it take so long to invent a printing press? why didn&#8217;t Yahweh pop one in at the first council of Nicea in 325 CE when they established biblical cannon?

If Jesus could see that the
ending to Mark would be added by a scribe, why wouldn&#8217;t he give the
disciples a perfect copy of his scripture (if eternal lives are gained
or lost on the authenticity and accuracy of such scripture).

Did Jesus have omniscience? Could he see the future? Could he see that [5 different endings to Mark would be added by five different scribes](http://www.errancywiki.com/index.php?title=Legends2)? Why didn&#8217;t he give his disciples an approved, inerrant version of his teachings? If salvation from an eternal torment in conscious pain requires belief in the accuracy and availability of scripture, why didn&#8217;t God ensure that the scripture could be accurately copied and transmitted from the very start of the early Church?

Even in an age when most Chrisitans do have 4-7 bibles in their home, most don&#8217;t read them. In one study, one in ten Americans thought that [Noah&#8217;s wife was Joan of Arc, and two thirds thought Billy Graham preached the Sermon on the Mount](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2007/0704.balmer.html). Most people&#8217;s favourite verse in the bible was &#8220;God helps those who help themselves.&#8221; Ironically, in a time of rising illiteracy, we also see conservatives demanding belief in [young earth creationism](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/exploringourmatrix/2012/06/ken-ham-wants-other-christians-to-be-con-artists-like-he-is.html) and [inerrancy (not infallability)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention_conservative_resurgence), bordering on &#8220;[biblicalism](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/2012/03/guest-post-the-culture-of-biblical-inerrantism/)&#8221;.

[debunking]:http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/god-science-and-black-death-plague.html
[hell]:http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/hell.htm

If Jesus had omniscience, could he fortell of the [millions that would die in the Black Plague][debunking]? Could he fortell that it would take the scientific method centuaries after the plague to understand how to stop the spread of disease? He decided to let people know that hell burns eternally at [the boiling point of Sulfur, 444.6 degrees Celcius](http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/hell.htm), but did he tell people how long to boil water for to sterilise surgical tools?

When Republican Senate candidate Richard Mourdock said pregnancy resulting from rape is something “[God intended to happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl9e-f6nbd4),” leading many to ask the question; does that mean the rape is something God intended to happen? Medicine has established the germ theory of disease (still denied by Mary Bakker Eddy&#8217;s Christian Science cult) only from studying dead bodies. Did God providentially provide the bodies?  If God has given us knowledge and the ability to use logic, why not give us the brains to innovate faster and prevent unnecessary deaths? 

Consider how bad medical knowledge was thoughout the dark ages. Carl Sagan writes in The Demon Haunted World:
>pre-modern medical practice did not save many. Queen
Anne was the last Stuart monarch of Great Britain. In the last seventeen
years of the seventeenth century, she was pregnant eighteen times. Only five
children were born alive. Only one of them survived infancy. He died before
reaching adulthood, and before her coronation in 1702. There seems to be no
evidence of some genetic disorder. She had the best medical care money
could buy.

If God could have providentially sent scientists at any point in human history, why wait over a millenium to give humans the germ theory of disease. Why wait until after Queen Anne to give humans knowledge of Obstetrics and Gynecology? It seems more likely that humans have picked themselves up by their bootstraps, and the West is [experiencing a period of unprecedented peace and prosperity](http://thegatesnotes.com/Books/Personal/The-Better-Angels-of-Our-Nature), while religion continues to [perpetuate war and suffering in the thirld world](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPDlgq-znrY&list=PL9zmXhEAnxT9hXW_2NJ7ZvdbiMuwSN5Ll&index=6).

I believe that [promoting human flourishing and the minimisation of suffering rather than any ideology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFDJJ1KydgE) will have the biggest positive impact on humankind. In fact, the pursuit of ideologies can often get in the way of humanist values. Consider the case of a 22-year-old Salvadoran woman with Lupus having to [seek approval to abort her brainless foetus from the Salvadoran Supreme Court](http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/el-salvador-must-provide-pregnant-woman-access-life-saving-medical-treatment-2013-04-17), after all abortions were banned in 1998. Despite the fact that the foetus will never be conscious, or able to feel pain, Catholic Bishops are campaigning not to let the woman terminate the pregnancy that threatens her life. In my opinion, this is the dangerous product of basing decisions on ideology, not facts.

Already as I write this some people will be asking where they went wrong. Was it that they didn&#8217;t share enough [testamints](http://www.ship-of-fools.com/gadgets/food_drink/015.html) or didn&#8217;t buy me the [Full Armor of God Pyjamas](http://wp.patheos.com/blogs/unreasonablefaith/files/2009/07/armor-of-god-pjs.jpg) or was it that I acquired critical thinking skills? Probably the pyjamas.

As a humanist, I believe that the promotion of human welfare should trump ideology, and this is enough of a purpose in life. Robert Green Ingersoll [stated it like this](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Robert_G._Ingersoll):
>Reason, observation and experience&#8230; have taught us that happiness is the only good; that the time to be happy is now, the place to be happy is here and the way to be happy is to make others so. This is enough for us. In this belief we are content to live and die.

I am happy to publicly state my opinion and I believe that everybody who wants to should be able to question every belief that I hold, attack every doctrine that I mainain and answer every question that I pose. But there&#8217;s a time and a place for this. Until then, why not just be friends? Don&#8217;t do this:
