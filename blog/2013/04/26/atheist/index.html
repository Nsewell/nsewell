<div class="entry-content"><p>Earlier this month shocking news broke that <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-07/women-missing-for-years-found-alive-in-house/4674150">three women who had been adbucted and imprisoned for nine to twelve whole years had escaped</a>. Michelle Knight was kidnapped in 2002 aged 20, Georgina DeJesus was 14 when she was kidnapped. Some of the women had childen by their captor, and Michelle Knight reportedly was forced to deliver them in unsanitary conditions, without any training. The women were rescued when a neighbour, who happened to have the day off, heard one of their screams and kicked down part of the door.</p>

<div class="youtube-lazy-link-info">Charles Ramsey interview, rescuer of Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight in Cleveland</div>
</a>
<div class="video-info" >CLEVELAND - After going missing more than 10 years ago, Amanda Berry shouted to a man from a Seymour Avenue house on Monday.
Charles Ramsey and Angel Cordero broke down the door and freed Berry, who was 16 when she disappeared in 2003. Cordero told NewsChannel5&#8217;s Stephanie Ramirez that he recognized Berry from posters and that she was with a 4 or 5-year-old child.

Other victims Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus.

</div>


<p>The neighbour, Charles Ramsey, had lived next door for a full year and ate together with the captor, with no idea what was happening inside the home. While the media says that he&#8217;s a hero, he insists that anyone else would have done the same thing in the circumstances. What has haunted him, however, was the knowledge that he could have intervened much earlier had he known.</p>

<p>One of the girls, Amanda Berry, had her face all over the news when she was kidnapped in 2003. Berry&#8217;s mother refused to give up hope of finding her daughter alive for 19 months, until she turned to a &#8220;psychic&#8221; who told her &#8221;<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/05/amanda_berry_is_dead_psychic_t.html">She’s not alive, honey</a>.&#8221; The poor woman died in 2006, never knowing that her daughter was alive.</p>

<p>On learning of her niece&#8217;s freedom, Georgina DeJesus&#8217;s aunt proclaimed that the rescue was a miracle, and &#8221;<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2013/05/08/cleveland-women-were-chained.html">God works in mysterious ways</a>&#8221;. One of the more disturbing revelations is that the rapist <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/may/08/cleveland-ariel-castro-child-abduction">was a school bus driver investigated by police in 2004 for abduction and endangering children</a> after he kept a boy on his school bus for two hours. Police officers turned up to the abductor&#8217;s home months before he kidnapped DeJesus, but left after nobody answered their knocks on the door. This is much like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping_of_Jaycee_Lee_Dugard#Missed_opportunities_to_rescue_Dugard">Jaycee Lee Dugard</a> case, where three years before the abducted girl was rescued, a neighbour informed the police there were tents in the abductor&#8217;s backyard with children living in them. Police talked with the abductor for 30 minutes on the property, but never searched it. After Dugard&#8217;s rescue, she was awarded a settlement of $20 million dollars from the Californian government for their mishandling of the case. Many people talk about the rescue of the girls being a miracle, and yet in both cases we see God failing to nudge the police in the right direction years before.</p>

<p>Consider this scenario: if you found a neighbour begging and pleading to escape the house, whould you intervene by kicking down the door straight away? Or if you would wait to let the captor free the girls of his own accord, how long would you wait for? Now consider: if you were God, would you intervene straight away if you heard a captive&#8217;s pleas? Would you choose to violate the captor&#8217;s free will in order to protect the women? If you would intervene straight away, why didn&#8217;t God intervene for Michelle Knight for over 12 years?</p>

<p>William Lane Craig defines God <a href="http://www.skepticink.com/reasonablyfaithless/2013/01/01/arguing-about-ontology/">in this way</a>: “God is, by definition, the greatest being conceivable.” Can you conceive of a God that doesn&#8217;t take 12 years to hear the cry of an abducted girl? Then it would seem that you can conceive of a greater being than the one Dr Craig believes in.</p>

<p>To me, the God of the Old Testament seems like a capricious and vindictive sort of character. Can you imagine a god that doesn&#8217;t endorse <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deut21.10-14&amp;version=NET">sex slavery for widows</a> or the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=num31&amp;version=NET">enslavement of 32,000 virgins for the enjoyment of Israelite soldiers as part of their &#8220;booty&#8221;</a>? What about a god that doesn&#8217;t <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/may/30/christian-fundamentalists-plan-teach-genocide">order the slaughter of Amalekite men, women and children</a> (often taught as a <a href="https://intrinsicdignity.wordpress.com/2010/04/19/good-news-club-on-the-slaughter-of-the-amalekites/">lesson in <em>complete</em> obedience</a>)? If you can imagine a deity without any of these bloodthirsty traits then by Dr Craig&#8217;s logic you&#8217;ve disproven the Old Testament god is the one true God.</p>

<p>What if you don&#8217;t like Paul&#8217;s views on <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1pet2.18;tit2.9;eph6.5-8&amp;version=NET">slaves</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=eph5.22-24&amp;version=NET">women</a> or <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1ti1.8-10;1cor6.9-10;rom1.18-32&amp;version=NET">gays</a>? Simple, just start your own faith tradition to worship your own interpretation of the Christian god. There are between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian#Demographics">38,000</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_denominations">41,000 Christian denominations</a> in the world, more than the <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=number%20of%20sentences%20in%20the%20bible">33,829 sentences in the KJV</a>. Some of these denominations are the same movement in different countries, but the figures show Christians have a wide diversity of opinion not just on liturgy but on core beliefs like the inspiration of scripture, the divinity of Jesus, the existence of hell, the role (if any) of baptism and any methods of salvation.</p>

<p>Protestants maintain that the only thing necessary for belief is scripture alone (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_scriptura">Sola Scriptura</a>).
If Protestantism is true, and a key part of Protestant Christian experience is reading the bible, why
did it take so long to invent a printing press? Why didn&#8217;t Yahweh pop one in at the first council of Nicea in 325 CE when they established biblical cannon?</p>

<p>If Jesus was the incarnation of the Logos of a triune godhead, did he have omniscience to see the future? Could he see that <a href="http://www.errancywiki.com/index.php?title=Legends2">5 different endings to Mark would be added by five different scribes</a>? Why didn&#8217;t he give his disciples an approved, inerrant version of his teachings? If salvation from an eternal torment in conscious pain requires the accurate transmission of scripture, why didn&#8217;t God ensure that the scripture could be accurately copied and transmitted from the very start of the early Church? Couldn&#8217;t that have minimised the number of differences of opinion between denominations?</p>

<p>Even in an age when most Chrisitans do have 4-7 bibles in their home, most don&#8217;t read them. In one study, 10% of Americans thought that <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2007/0704.balmer.html">Noah&#8217;s wife was Joan of Arc, and two thirds thought Billy Graham preached the Sermon on the Mount</a>. Most people&#8217;s favourite &#8220;bible verse&#8221; was &#8220;God helps those who help themselves.&#8221; Less than half of Americans could name one of the gospels, and only a third could name all four. It&#8217;s this kind of ignorance that leads to one of the best known quotes of Jesus saying &#8220;the poor you will always have among you&#8221; being <a href="www.smh.com.au/opinion/bible-bashing-the-homeless-abbott-style-20100215-o2tj.html">used to oppose aid for the poor</a> despite the fact that Jesus said it in the house of <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matt26.6-13;mark14.3-9&amp;version=NET">Simon the leper</a> while eating with <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jn12.1-8&amp;version=NET">Lazarus, who he raised from the dead</a>.</p>

<p>Ironically, in a time of rising illiteracy, we also see conservatives demanding belief in <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/exploringourmatrix/2012/06/ken-ham-wants-other-christians-to-be-con-artists-like-he-is.html">young earth creationism</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention_conservative_resurgence">inerrancy</a> of scripture (not infallability), bordering on &#8221;<a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/peterenns/2012/03/guest-post-the-culture-of-biblical-inerrantism/">biblicalism</a>&#8221;.</p>

<p>If Jesus had omniscience, could he fortell of the <a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/god-science-and-black-death-plague.html">millions that would die in the Black Plague</a>? Could he fortell that it would take the scientific method centuries after the plague to understand how to stop the spread of disease? He decided to let people know that hell burns eternally at <a href="http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/hell.htm">the boiling point of Sulfur, 444.6 degrees Celcius</a>, but did he tell people how long to boil water for to sterilise surgical tools?</p>

<p>When Republican Senate candidate Richard Mourdock said pregnancy resulting from rape is something “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wl9e-f6nbd4">God intended to happen</a>,” it lead many to ask the question; does that mean the rape is something God intended to happen? Medicine has established the germ theory of disease (still denied by Mary Bakker Eddy&#8217;s Christian Science cult) only from studying dead bodies. If it&#8217;s God&#8217;s will that modern medicine be able to treat sick people so that our Western life expectancies are many times what they were in the dark ages, did God preordain doctors to treat people? And if they needed cadavres to research, did God preordain that the knowledge would be gained from deaths?  If God has given us knowledge and the ability to use logic, why not give us the brains to innovate faster and prevent unnecessary deaths?</p>

<p>Consider how bad medical knowledge was throughout the dark ages. Carl Sagan writes in The Demon Haunted World:</p>

<blockquote><p>Pre-modern medical practice did not save many. Queen
Anne was the last Stuart monarch of Great Britain. In the last seventeen
years of the seventeenth century, she was pregnant eighteen times. Only five
children were born alive. Only one of them survived infancy. He died before
reaching adulthood, and before her coronation in 1702. There seems to be no
evidence of some genetic disorder. She had the best medical care money
could buy.</p></blockquote>

<p>If God could have providentially sent scientists at any point in human history, why wait over a millennium to give humans the germ theory of disease? Why wait until after Queen Anne&#8217;s demise to give humans knowledge of Obstetrics and Gynecology?</p>

<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t find myself able to believe that there is any God capable of influencing the world today. It seems more likely that humans have picked themselves up by their bootstraps, and while religion continues to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPDlgq-znrY&amp;list=PL9zmXhEAnxT9hXW_2NJ7ZvdbiMuwSN5Ll&amp;index=6">perpetuate violence and hostility in the third world</a> the West is <a href="http://thegatesnotes.com/Books/Personal/The-Better-Angels-of-Our-Nature">experiencing a period of unprecedented peace and prosperity</a>. In fact, it seems that for most of human history people have been <a href="http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/199704--.htm">expanding their circle of empathy</a> from themselves to their families, their churches, their nations and to collections of nations. The future of humanity will be brighter if we can expand this circle to all humans and even other animals and the environment:</p>

<p>I believe that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFDJJ1KydgE">promoting human flourishing and the minimisation of suffering rather than any ideology</a> will have the biggest positive impact on humankind. In fact, the pursuit of ideologies can often get in the way of human good. Consider the case of a 22-year-old Salvadoran woman with Lupus having to <a href="http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/el-salvador-must-provide-pregnant-woman-access-life-saving-medical-treatment-2013-04-17">seek approval to abort her brainless foetus from the Salvadoran Supreme Court</a>, after all abortions were banned in 1998. Despite the fact that the foetus will never be conscious, or able to feel pain, Catholic Bishops are campaigning not to let the woman terminate the pregnancy that threatens her life. In my opinion, this is the dangerous product of basing decisions on ideology, not facts.</p>

<p>As a humanist, I believe that the promotion of human welfare should trump ideology, and this is enough to have a worthwhile purpose in life. Robert Green Ingersoll <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Robert_G._Ingersoll">stated it like this</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Reason, observation and experience have taught us that happiness is the only good; that the time to be happy is now, the place to be happy is here and the way to be happy is to make others so. This is enough for us. In this belief we are content to live and die.</p></blockquote>

<p>Already as I write this some people will be asking where they went wrong. Was it that they didn&#8217;t share enough <a href="http://www.ship-of-fools.com/gadgets/food_drink/015.html">testamints</a> or didn&#8217;t buy me the <a href="http://wp.patheos.com/blogs/unreasonablefaith/files/2009/07/armor-of-god-pjs.jpg">Full Armor of God Pyjamas</a> or was it that I acquired critical thinking skills and wrestled with these and other questions? Probably the pyjamas. Of course, Chrsitianity has taught me many <a href="http://christiannymphos.org/2009/07/09/cunnilingus-101/">useful things</a> and I still enjoy reading Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes. I am truly happy that while some sermons have verged on putting me to sleep, no preacher has ever <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVCQbVcnCwA">punched me in the face</a> or insisted that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQSmtNbraGU">I save my kiss until marriage</a>.</p>

<p>Some fundamentalist churches teach to love your neighbour, but hate Hindus, Buddhists, atheists, Muslims, gays, Jews, blacks and anyone suspected of being a feminist. This might make sense in a small street in a leafy suburb, but does it work if you live in an apartment? What happens when your digital neighbours are not just the 10 people you know on your street but the 600 people you know on social media? You&#8217;re going to hear the attitude and opinions of people with differing political, religious and ideological views. And really, when Jesus restated Leviticus 19:34 with the command to love your neighbour as yourself, he did not say love your male neighbour, or love your white neighbour, or love your straight neighbour, or love your believing neighbour. Don&#8217;t do this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/unicorn-shun.jpg" alt="Shuun the non-believer!" /></p>

<p>I am happy to publicly state my opinion and I believe that everybody who wants to should be able to question every belief that I hold, attack every doctrine that I maintain and answer every question that I pose. But there&#8217;s a time and a place for this. Until then, why not just be friends?</p>
