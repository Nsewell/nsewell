<div class="entry-content"><p>Consider this, you live next to a man who you know is raping his daughter. Do you intervene?</p>

<p>I mentioned rejecting the ontological argument along these lines:</p>

<blockquote><p>God is the greatest conceivable being.
I can conceive of a greater being than Yahweh.
Therefore, Yahweh is not God.</p></blockquote>

<p>“God is, by definition, the greatest being conceivable.”</p>

<p>There are between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian#Demographics">38,000</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_denominations">41,000 Christian denominations</a>, more than the <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=number%20of%20sentences%20in%20the%20bible">33,829 sentences in the KJV</a>. Some of these denominations are the same movement in different countries, but the figures show a remarkable diversity of opinion not just on liturgy but on scripture and theology.</p>

<p>Protestants maintain that the only thing necessary for belief is scripture alone (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sola_scriptura">Sola Scriptura</a>). If this is correct, and all Catholics are in error, then why didn&#8217;t Jesus give his disciples a printing press? Or why didn&#8217;t Yahweh pop one in at the first council of Nicea in 325 CE?</p>

<p>Did Jesus have omniscience? Could he see the future? Could he see that <a href="http://www.errancywiki.com/index.php?title=Legends2">5 different endings to Mark would be added by five different scribes</a>? Why didn&#8217;t he give his disciples an approved version?</p>

<p>If salvation from an eternal torment in conscious pain requires belief in the accuracy and availability of scripture, why didn&#8217;t God ensure that the scripture could be accurately copied and transmitted from the very start of the early Church?</p>

<p>If Jesus had omniscience, could he fortell of the <a href="http://debunkingchristianity.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/god-science-and-black-death-plague.html">millions that would die in the Black Plague</a>?
Medicine has established the germ theory of disease (still denied by Mary Bakker Eddy&#8217;s Christian Science cult) only from studying dead bodies.</p>

<p>The other thing I&#8217;d say is that if God has given us knowledge and the
ability to use logic, why not give us the brains to innovate faster and
prevent unnecessary deaths?</p>

<p>If Protestantism is true, and a foundation
principle of Protestantism is Sola Scriptura (by scripture alone), and a
key part of Protestant Christian experience is reading the bible, why
did it take so long to invent a printing press? Why didn&#8217;t God give the
first council of Nicea the printing press? If Jesus could see that the
ending to Mark would be added by a scribe, why wouldn&#8217;t he give the
disciples a perfect copy of his scripture (if eternal lives are gained
or lost on the authenticity and accuracy of such scripture).</p>

<blockquote><p>pre-modern medical practice did not save many. Queen
Anne was the last Stuart monarch of Great Britain. In the last seventeen
years of the seventeenth century, she was pregnant eighteen times. Only five
children were born alive. Only one of them survived infancy. He died before
reaching adulthood, and before her coronation in 1702. There seems to be no
evidence of some genetic disorder. She had the best medical care money
could buy.</p></blockquote>

<p>If God could have providentially sent scientists at any point in human history, why wait over a millenium to give humans the germ theory of disease. Why wait until after Queen Anne to give humans knowledge of Obstetrics and Gynecology?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.skepticink.com/reasonablyfaithless/2012/12/22/the-ontological-argument-meets-christianity/">Source is
here,</a>
He has a further discussion of the ontological argument
<a href="http://www.skepticink.com/reasonablyfaithless/2013/01/01/arguing-about-ontology/">here</a></p>

<p>David mentioned the Transcendental argument. TAG is often used in
presuppostitional apologetics, which is clearly circular reasoning
(Assume the properties of God, those properties couldn&#8217;t exist without
God, therefore God).</p>

<p>There seems to be a fallacy of equivocation between reality and our
conceptual modelling of it. The conceptual logical statement &#8216;A=A&#8217; does
not exist in nature, but that does not mean that atoms are not atoms.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s more of a takedown on:</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.ironchariots.org/index.php?title=Transcendental_argument">Iron Chariots</a></p>

<p><a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Transcendental_argument_for_God">RationalWiki</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_argument_for_the_existence_of_God">Wikipedia</a></p>

<p>If Jesus had omniscience to see the Black Plague, why didn&#8217;t he give
humans antibiotics?
The clincher, to me, is that many human innovations like medicine, that
preserve life, are discovered in death.
John Loftus describes the problem here:
