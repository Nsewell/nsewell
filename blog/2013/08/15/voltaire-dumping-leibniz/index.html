<div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/krauss-craig.jpg" alt="William Lane Craig and Lawrence Krauss at Sydney Town Hall" />
Earlier this week William Lane Craig and Lawrence Krauss discussed cosmologogy and arguments for and against the existence of God. Professor Krauss concluded his opening remarks warning the audience against following the logic of syllogisms like this one:</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>All mammals exhibit homosexual behaviour</li>
<li>William Lane Craig is a mammal</li>
<li>Therefore, William Lane Craig exhibits homosexual behaviour</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Krauss briefly noted that the 2003 paper by Arvind Borde, Alan Guth, and Alexander Vilenkin (BGV hypothesis) that the universe has a beginning has issues.
Craig has previously tried to use the BGV hypothesis to suggest that the universe must have a beginning, and therefore a creator.
But as Vilenkin has pointed out <a href="https://debunkingwlc.wordpress.com/2010/07/14/borde-guth-vilenkin/">in his book</a> it would be &#8220;far too simplistic&#8221; to use his work to prove the existence of God (on the same page Dr Craig quotes from to support his argument). Further, Vilenkin mentioned in <a href="http://arizonaatheist.blogspot.com.au/2010/05/william-lane-craigs-arguments-for-god.html">an email</a> &#8220;the expansion of the universe must have had a beginning. You can evade the theorem by postulating that the universe was contracting prior to some time.&#8221; Craig has also relied on trying to say that because some collections cannot be infinite, <a href="http://www.skepticink.com/reasonablyfaithless/2013/03/25/infinity-minus-infinity/">no collections can be infinite, and past time cannot be infinite</a>.</p>

<p>Krauss went on to criticise the second premise of Craig&#8217;s version of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz&#8217;s cosmological argument, before Dr Craig went on to present it as &#8220;logically airtight.&#8221; The first premise is Leibniz&#8217;s Principle of Sufficient Reason, which is applied to the universe:</p>

<blockquote><ol>
<li>Anything that exists has an explanation of its existence, either in the necessity of its own nature or in an external cause</li>
<li>If the universe has an explanation of its existence, that explanation is God.</li>
<li>The universe exists.</li>
<li>Therefore, the universe has an explanation of its existence (from 1, 3)</li>
<li>Therefore, the explanation of the existence of the universe is God (from 2, 4).</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Craig also presents a <a href="http://mind.ucsd.edu/syllabi/02-03/01w/readings/taylor.pdf">Richard Taylor’s</a> illustration of a translucent ball, saying that if someone found a transluscent ball in nature they would probably seek an explanation for the ball&#8217;s exsistence rather than deciding it just exists inexplicably. He claims that the same should apply whether the ball is the size of a person, a car, a planet or a universe. But no matter the size of the ball, we still need evidence to <a href="http://www.maverick-atheism.org/2012/09/leibnizian-cosmological-argument-2.html">determine if the ball began to exist, or has an external cause</a>. And as Victor Stenger states &#8220;no cause is evident in the decay of a radioactive nucleus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Krauss went on to mention how many things in the universe seem to have an apparent design, but are formed randomly. For instance, geodesic domes seem to be designed, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminsterfullerene">Carbon-60 forms a structure that resembles a geodesic dome</a>. Similarly, life was once thought to be &#8220;fine tuned&#8221; by God on Earth, until we had evidence that self-replicating organic molecules can gain information by evolution though natural selection. And while the universe may appear to be designed for life, the fact that it is the only universe known to have life is not surprising as we&#8217;re in it.</p>

<p>Craig suggested that theology is &#8220;the queen of the sciences&#8221; despite having previously asserted that God is not subject to science. Krauss asked what new information theology had provided in the past 300 years (and mentioned that biology and physics can answer that question without arguing over the semantics of &#8216;knowledge&#8217;). The moderator moved on to another question. Krauss had previously mentioned that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz">Leibniz</a>, who died in 1716 had no awareness of Quantum Mechanics, so his views on cosmology were irrelevant.</p>

<p>I would argue that not only are Leibinz&#8217;s ideas irrelevant, they&#8217;ve already been dumped on by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire">Voltaire</a>. Leibniz believed that this world is the best of all possible worlds, and coined the word theodicy for his defence of a good God in a world that has much evil. His satirical novella <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candide">Candide</a> eloquently skewers the notion with the ideas of Dr Pangloss (&#8220;All Talk&#8221;):</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;It is demonstrable,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that things cannot be otherwise than as they are; for all being created for an end, all is necessarily for the best end. Observe, that the nose has been formed to bear spectacles—thus we have spectacles. Legs are visibly designed for stockings—and we have stockings. Stones were made to be hewn, and to construct castles—therefore my lord has a magnificent castle; for the greatest baron in the province ought to be the best lodged. Pigs were made to be eaten—therefore we eat pork all the year round. Consequently they who assert that all is well have said a foolish thing, they should have said all is for the best.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, this world of cause and effect exists for <em>sufficient reason</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>One day Cunegonde, while walking near the castle, in a little wood which they called a park, saw between the bushes, Dr. Pangloss giving a lesson in experimental natural philosophy to her mother&#8217;s chamber-maid, a little brown wench, very pretty and very docile. As Miss Cunegonde had a great disposition for the sciences, she breathlessly observed the repeated experiments of which she was a witness; she clearly perceived the force of the Doctor&#8217;s reasons, the effects, and the causes; she turned back greatly flurried, quite pensive, and filled with the desire to be learned; dreaming that she might well be a <strong>sufficient reason</strong> for young Candide, and he for her.</p>

<p>She met Candide on reaching the castle and blushed; Candide blushed also; she wished him good morrow in a faltering tone, and Candide spoke to her without knowing what he said. The next day after dinner, as they went from table, Cunegonde and Candide found themselves behind a screen; Cunegonde let fall her handkerchief, Candide picked it up, she took him innocently by the hand, the youth as innocently kissed the young lady&#8217;s hand with particular vivacity, sensibility, and grace; their lips met, their eyes sparkled, their knees trembled, their hands strayed. Baron Thunder-ten-Tronckh passed near the screen and beholding this <strong>cause and effect</strong> chased Candide from the castle with great kicks on the backside; Cunegonde fainted away; she was boxed on the ears by the Baroness, as soon as she came to herself; and all was consternation in this most magnificent and most agreeable of all possible castles.</p></blockquote>

<p>He goes on to satirically reflect on the theodicy of Leibniz&#8217;s free will defence:</p>

<blockquote><p>After the earthquake had destroyed three-fourths of Lisbon, the sages of that country could think of no means more effectual to prevent utter ruin than to give the people a beautiful auto-da-fé; for it had been decided by the University of Coimbra, that the burning of a few people alive by a slow fire, and with great ceremony, is an infallible secret to hinder the earth from quaking.</p>

<p>In consequence hereof, they had seized on a Biscayner, convicted of having married his godmother, and on two Portuguese, for rejecting the bacon which larded a chicken they were eating; after dinner, they came and secured Dr. Pangloss, and his disciple Candide, the one for speaking his mind, the other for having listened with an air of approbation. They were conducted to separate apartments, extremely cold, as they were never incommoded by the sun&#8230; They marched in procession thus habited and heard a very pathetic sermon, followed by fine church music. Candide was whipped in cadence while they were singing; the Biscayner, and the two men who had refused to eat bacon, were burnt; and Pangloss was hanged, though that was not the custom. The same day the earth sustained a most violent concussion.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lenny Bernstein&#8217;s oparetta is similarly brilliant. This is him conducting the opening overture:</p>
