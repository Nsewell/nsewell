<div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/abbott.jpg" title="&#34;Tony Abbott&#34;" alt="&#34;Tony Abbott&#34;"></p>

<p>On assylum seekers:</p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;These people aren’t so much seeking asylum, they’re seeking permanent residency. If they were happy with temporary protection visas, then they might be able to argue better that they were asylum seekers&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-08-22/tony-abbott-blames-carbon-tax-for-uncertainty/4216308">Interview with Leigh Sales, 22nd August 2012</a></p>

<blockquote><p> TONY ABBOTT: Yeah. Don’t forget Jesus drove the traders from the temple as well. Now, I mean, you know&#8230;<br/>
 TONY JONES: What’s the analogy?<br/>
 TONY ABBOTT: &#8230;Jesus didn’t say yes to everyone. I mean Jesus knew that there was a place for everything and it is not necessarily everyone’s place to come to Australia&#8230; Jesus was the best man who ever lived but that doesn’t mean that he said yes to everyone, that he was permissive to everything, and this idea that Jesus would say to every person who wanted to come to Australia, “Fine”, the door is open, I just don’t think is necessarily right</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s2859473.htm">From Q&amp;A 5 April 2010</a>. The statement was in response to a question &#8220;what would Jesus do&#8221; on assylum seekers, which unfortunately goaded Abbott into likening himself to Jesus. One bible&#8217;s footnote suggests Jesus drove out the temple traders because &#8220;Not only were the religious leaders robbing the people financially, but because of this they had also robbed them spiritually by stealing from them the opportunity to come to know God genuinely.&#8221; In many ways it&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.unchristian.com/pdfs/Too_Political.pdf">right wing co-opting religion that is a major factor in young generations ditching Christianity</a>.</p>

<p>On rights at work:</p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;If we’re honest, most of us would accept that a bad boss is a little bit like a bad father or a bad husband … you find that he tends to do more good than harm. He might be a bad boss but at least he’s employing someone while he is in fact a boss.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On abortion:</p>

<blockquote><p> ‘The problem with the Australian practice of abortion is that an objectively grave matter has been reduced to a question of the mother’s convenience.&#8221;</p>

<p> “If half the effort were put into discouraging teenage promiscuity as goes into preventing teenage speeding, there might be fewer abortions, fewer traumatised young women and fewer dysfunctional families.”</p>

<p> “Why isn’t the fact that 100,000 women choose to end their pregnancies regarded as a national tragedy approaching the scale, say, of Aboriginal life expectancy being 20 years less than that of the general community?”</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.tonyabbott.com.au/LatestNews/ArticleswrittenbyTony/tabid/87/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/3653/RATE-OF-ABORTION-HIGHLIGHTS-OUR-MORAL-FAILINGS.aspx">From an address to the Adelaide University Democratic Club in 2004</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;In Australia, as elsewhere, one of the great totems of liberation from authority has been abortion on demand. Spurred by pictures of 12-week-old unborn babies being dismembered, some women’s activists have started to question the abortion culture. Abortion may not be the precise moral equivalent of infanticide but it’s not just removing an inconvenient wart or cyst either.<br/>
Since 1996, contrary to poltical correctness, the Australian parliament has overturned right-to-kill laws and (almost) banned gay marriage. Perhaps a political constituency may even be starting to emerge to ban abortions after 20 weeks. Thoughtful feminists are starting to grieve over the downstream consequences of sexual freedom.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<li>From a <a href="http://www.tonyabbott.com.au/LatestNews/ArticleswrittenbyTony/tabid/87/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/3655/categoryId/4/TRADITIONAL-MORAL-VALUES-A-REVELATION.aspx">speech delivered at the CIS Consilium in Queensland, July 31 2004</a>.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p> &#8220;The problem is backyard miscarriages if unscrupulous doctors prescribe these drugs for desperate women. “</p>

<p> &#8220;If an application did come to me, I would have to satisfy myself that compelent doctors would administer the drug in safe circumstances to women who had fully considered the alternatives and understood the risks”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;You don’t have to be a Catholic to be troubled by the current abortion culture”</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/sundayprofile/stories/s1389511.htm"> From Sunday Profile 12 June 2005.</a></p>

<p>On aid to the ‘third world’ funding abortions:</p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;I just think that surely there are higher priorities for Australia than funding things like that.”</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s2514401.htm"> From Q&amp;A 19 March 2009.</a></p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;Mr Speaker, we have a bizarre double standard; a bizarre double standard in this country where some-one who kills a pregnant woman’s baby is guilty of murder, but a woman who aborts an unborn baby is simply exercising choice.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/hansard/reps/dailys/dr150206.pdf">In Parliament (pdf), 15 Feb 2006.</a></p>

<p>On Bernie Banton:</p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;I know Bernie is very sick, but just because a person is sick doesn’t mean that he is necessarily pure of heart in all things.”</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/federalelection2007news/abbott-accuses-asbestos-fighter-of-political-stunt/2007/10/30/1193618883990.html"> Said to Channel 9 reporter about asbestos sufferer and social justice campaigner Bernie Banton October 2007.</a></p>

<p>On women:</p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;I think it would be folly to expect that women will ever dominate or even approach equal representation in a large number of areas simply because their aptitudes, abilities and interests are different for physiological reasons”</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2010/s2846485.htm"> From Four Corners 15 March 2010</a></p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;What the housewives of Australia need to understand as they do the ironing is that if they get it done commercially it’s going to go up in price and their own power bills when they switch the iron on are going to go up, every year….&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/abbott-accused-of-being-incredibly-oldfashioned-as-he-lets-off-steam-20100209-nnqr.html"> Comments on the carbon tax in February 2010.</a></p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;[virginity] is the greatest gift that you can give someone, the ultimate gift of giving, and don&#8217;t give it to someone lightly&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-01-27/abbott-defends-virginity-comments/310704">Comments in Australian Women&#8217;s Weekly on what advice he would give his daughters on sex before marriage</a>. Many Christian commentators have noted that <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/frankschaeffer/2012/10/evangelical-sexy-virginity-panties-for-jesus-and-romney/">promoting virginity over chastity is counter-productive</a>.</p>

<p>On families:</p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;I think there does need to be give and take on both sides, and this idea that sex is kind of a woman’s right to absolutely withhold, just as the idea that sex is a man’s right to demand I think they are both they both need to be moderated, so to speak&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s2514401.htm"> From Q&amp;A 19 March 2009.</a></p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;The point I make in the book is that a society… is surely capable of providing additional recognition to what might be thought of as traditional marriage…. Something akin to a Matrimonial Causes Act marriage ought to be an option for people who would like it.”</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/07/14/2625441.htm"> On the reintroduction of at fault-divorce July 2009.</a></p>

<p>On teenagers:</p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;The Government accepts that some 14 and 15-year-olds might prefer that their parents not know about the medical procedures they have had or the prescription drugs they are on. But children should not be presumed to be the best judges of their own long-term interests and should not have the right to go behind their parents’ backs… The real issue here is whether 14 and 15-year-olds can make informed decisions about what is right and wrong for them. And if they don’t have that capacity, should they be allowed to operate in a moral and ethical vacuum?”</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/general/mind-your-own-medicine/2004/06/12/1086749940114.html"> On Howard legislation giving parents access data about government benefits provided to their teenagers (for example, young women’s Medicare claims related to contraceptive advice), June 2004.</a></p>

<p> On whether a national celibacy campaign would be helpful to counter the rise in teen sexual activity, sexual infections and pregnancies:</p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;I think that it’s very important that we empower people to reject this kind of rampant sensuality.”</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s2514401.htm"> From Q&amp;A 19 March 2009.</a></p>

<p>On Julia Gillard:</p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;Gillard won’t lie down and die&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On climate change:</p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;Climate change is absolute crap&#8221;</p>

<p> &#8220;If you want to put a price on carbon why not just do it with a simple tax.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On homosexuality:</p>

<blockquote><p> LIZ HAYES: Homosexuality? How do you feel about that?
 TONY ABBOTT: I’d probably I feel a bit threatened…</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=1020354"> From an interview on 60 minutes March 2010</a></p>

<blockquote><p> LEIGH SALES: What was “threatened” referring to?<br/>
 TONY ABBOTT: Well, there is no doubt that it challenges, if you like, orthodox notions of the right order of things…</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2010/s2840098.htm"> From an interview on Lateline March 2010</a></p>

<p>On gay people being members of a Catholic congregation:</p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;If you’d asked me for advice I would have said to have – adopt a sort of “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy about all of these things…&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s2514401.htm"> From Q&amp;A 19 March 2009.</a></p>

<p>On Indigenous Australia:</p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;Now, I know that there are some Aboriginal people who aren’t happy with Australia Day. For them it remains Invasion Day. I think a better view is the view of Noel Pearson, who has said that Aboriginal people have much to celebrate in this country’s British Heritage&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s2859473.htm"> From Q&amp;A 5 April 2010.</a></p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;Even if dispossession is taken to mean that government has a higher responsibility to Aborigines than to other Australians, the production of beautiful art and connectedness to the land does not warrant the maintenance of a way of life also characterised by unemployment, substance abuse and domestic violence. If people choose to live in difficult to service places, that’s their business.”</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.tonyabbott.com.au/LatestNews/ArticleswrittenbyTony/tabid/87/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/6944/NEW-MISSION-TO-ASSIST.aspx"> From an article published in The Australian 27 June 2008.</a></p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;Western civilisation came to this country in 1788 and I’m proud of that…”</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2010/s2846485.htm"> From Four Corners 15 March 2010</a></p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;There may not be a great job for them but whatever there is, they just have to do it, and if it’s picking up rubbish around the community, it just has to be done&#8221;</p>

<p> TONY JONES: So are you making a case against teaching in indigenous languages? Is that what – I’m trying to get on top of the point you’re making.<br/>
 TONY ABBOTT: Well, I am making that case.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/txt/s2662208.htm?show=transcript"> From Q&amp;A 27 August 2009.  </a></p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;Racism used to be offered as the complete explanation for Aboriginal poverty, alienation and early death. Racism hasn’t disappeared. Still, if racism caused poverty, why hasn’t poverty declined as racism diminished.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;amp;q=cache:hinB3OrHq3cJ:parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/media/pressrel/VXVE6/upload_binary/vxve66.pdf%3BfileType%3Dapplication/pdf+Racism+used+to+be+offered+as+the+complete+explanation+for+Aboriginal+poverty,+alienation+and+early+death.+Racism+hasn%E2%80%99t+disappeared.+Still,+if+racism+caused+poverty,+why+hasn%E2%80%99t+poverty+declined+as+racism+diminished.&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=au&amp;amp;pid=bl&amp;amp;srcid=ADGEESgqNBMVUJemOsBVODTFxa0wZOqz-g4I3sc_Thh7S1nkdEcSDy028GUv8lYEOCT7DRqTyZ3gfpDU3hur12CMfCcIpD0Qy5nrkcfuTBT1udBZb8Bbuy6rhVLR8Qgvn_AE51_iHz5x&amp;amp;sig=AHIEtbTSaJmxOyYRt-0xAuieaxgsXMEPjA"> From a paper presented to The Bennelong Society (pdf), September 2004.</a></p>

<p>On Nicola Roxon:</p>

<blockquote><p> Ms Roxon: &#8220;You can&#8217;t even get here on time&#8230; I&#8217;m sure had you wanted to you could.&#8221;<br/>
 Mr Abbott: &#8220;That&#8217;s bullshit. You&#8217;re being deliberately unpleasant. I suppose you can&#8217;t help yourself, can you?&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>On homelessness and poverty:</p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;…we just can’t stop people from being homeless if that’s their choice…”</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/abbotts-tough-love-not-their-cup-of-tea-20100215-o2vx.html"> Said to a Catholic social services conference February 2010.</a></p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;It’s the responsibility of government to try to put policies in place which over time will allow people to improve their situation. But we can’t abolish poverty because poverty in part is a function of individual behaviour.
 We can’t stop people drinking; we can’t stop people gambling; we can’t stop people having substance problems; we can’t stop people from making mistakes that cause them to be less well-off than they might otherwise be. “</p></blockquote>

<p>On the death penalty:</p>

<blockquote><p> &#8220;I’d always been against the death penalty but that contemplating the enormity of certain sort of crimes I sometimes thought that some crimes were so hideous that if the punishment were to fit maybe we were left with no alternative but the death penalty.”</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=1020354"> From an interview on 60 minutes March 2010</a></p>
