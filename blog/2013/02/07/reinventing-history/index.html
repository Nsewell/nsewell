<div class="entry-content"><blockquote><p>There is a funny thing about history. Even though there are countless books waiting to be investigated and read, myriad articles from the times, and an abundance of other evidence, we human beings would <a href="https://mabworld.wordpress.com/2012/02/27/the-fundamentalist-history-they-dont-want-you-to-know/">rather have someone else — one of our contemporaries — tell us what it is</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>As George Orwell opined in <em>Ninteen Eighty Four</em>, &#8220;whoever controls the present controls the past&#8221;.
Even though the US senate in 1797 that &#8221;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tripoli">the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion</a>,&#8221; it&#8217;s become common to hear right wing Christians insist the opposite:</p>

<div class="figure"><a href="http://theamericanjesus.net/?p=3881"><img src="/images/jesus-constitution.jpg" link="http://theamericanjesus.net/?p=3881" title="Jesus giving the US constitution to the founding fathers by Jon McNaughton" ><p>Jesus giving the US constitution to the founding fathers by Jon McNaughton</span></a></div>


<p>Demographic changes in the United States mean that white evangelical Christians are a smaller and smaller voting bloc. As the Religious Right attempting to broaden their base to black and latino Christians, they emphasise anti-abortion and anti-gay positions, and try to downplay their history of segregationalist and White Supremacist links. They also try to claim that they have always been against legal access to abortions, despite <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5502785">evidence to the contrary</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Although various Roman Catholic groups denounced the ruling, and Christianity Today complained that the Roe decision “runs counter to the moral teachings of Christianity through the ages but also to the moral sense of the American people,” the vast majority of evangelical leaders said virtually nothing about it; many of those who did comment actually applauded the decision. W. Barry Garrett of Baptist Press wrote, “Religious liberty, human equality and justice are advanced by the Supreme Court abortion decision.” Indeed, even before the Roe decision, the messengers (delegates) to the 1971 Southern Baptist Convention gathering in St. Louis, Missouri, adopted a resolution that stated, “we call upon Southern Baptists to work for legislation that will allow the possibility of abortion under such conditions as rape, incest, clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother.” W.A. Criswell, former president of the Southern Baptist Convention and pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas, expressed his satisfaction with the Roe v. Wade ruling. “I have always felt that it was only after a child was born and had a life separate from its mother that it became an individual person,” the redoubtable fundamentalist declared, “and it has always, therefore, seemed to me that what is best for the mother and for the future should be allowed.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Religious Right wants to paint themselves as having always been anti-abortion, and tends to be quiet on their position about racism and civil rights. The Republicans have a history of inviting White Supremicist speakers to the Conservative Political Action Comitee, while at the same time trying to broaden their base to black voters. In fact, one of the biggest issues to galvinise white evangelical voters is opposition to the civil rights movement. Paul Weyrich of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress said:</p>

<blockquote><p>“What galvanised the Christian community was not abortion, school prayer, or the ERA. I am living witness to that because I was trying to get those people interested in those issues and I utterly failed. What changed their mind was Jimmy Carter’s intervention against the Christian schools, trying to deny them tax-exempt status on the basis of so-called de-facto segregation.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The religious right is now attempting to get black voters to join an anti-gay campaign, claiming that they were always on the side of civil rights. Matt Barber, the law dean of Liberty University (founded on pro-segregationalist grounds by Jerry Falwell) <a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/matt-barber-whose-idol-backed-segregation-lectures-everyone-else-about-civil-rights-movement">claimed that the gay movement has &#8220;cynically co-opted and hijacked the language of the very, very noble civil rights movement and applied it to their disordered lifestyle.”</a></p>

<p>Next thing they&#8217;ll try and claim that Chrsitians have always been <a href="http://www.lva.virginia.gov/lib-edu/education/psd/nation/halifax.htm">against slavery</a>. When the Theistic Evolution crowd convinces more Christians of the scientific truth of evolution (that it is more than &#8220;just a theory&#8221;), they&#8217;ll claim that Christians always thought Genesis was compatible with science. And when the numbers of Americans opposing gay marriage drops they will next claim that they always supported gay rights. <a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/survey-less-americans-believe-homosexuality-is-a-sin-nations-view-evolving-with-obamas-88141/">44% of Americans believed that homosexuality is a sin in September 2011, dropping to 37% in November 2012</a>, and <a href="http://www.lifeway.com/ArticleView?storeId=10054&amp;article=research-same-sex-marriage-civil-rights-issue-americans-say">64% think same-sex marriage is inevitable</a>. Is it because hollywood is pushing a campaign? Is it because political correctness is popular? Or is it because the media has exposed how, if evangelicals had their way, homosexuality would have the death penalty, like it is now in Uganda?</p>

<p>The more that Christians understand of their own history, the more they&#8217;ll start to realise that many of their key doctrines (like the idea that all of the bible is literally true and without error) are actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Baptist_Convention_conservative_resurgence">new inventions</a>.</p>
