<div class="entry-content"><p>Conservatives love to bemoan how &#8220;Hollywood values&#8221; are not in line with their own views, and how the views of young people differing from their own must be a result of the media and colleges having a &#8220;liberal bias&#8221;. While the media that people consume may be an embodiment of cultural values at the time, unless anything particularly eggregious is being marketed to children that have no understanding of society&#8217;s views then this is mostly an overreaction. This particularly plays into the way that people view female musicians, that tend to be criticised simultaneously for beeing too sexual and not sexy enough.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to briefly look at a few female performers, and the kinds of expectations placed on them by different sectors of the community.</p>

<h3>Katy Perry - By the Grace of God</h3>

<p>Katy Perry started her musical career as a Christian singer writing songs on theology and her love of Jesus. While her breakthough hit <em>I Kissed a Girl</em> attracted international attention for it&#8217;s playful insinuation of lesbian experimentation, Perry has never really sexualised her image relative to other stars.</p>

<p>In a June 2012 interview Perry noted that her next album &#8220;would be a much darker album than the previous one. It was inevitable, after what I went through.&#8221;
She noted &#8220;When you lose something, all your foundations crumble-but that also <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5740580/katy-perrys-prism-the-billboard-cover-story?page=all">leaves a big hole that&#8217;s open for something great to come through</a>.&#8221; The album has gone in dark directions for some tracks, <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/5740580/katy-perrys-prism-the-billboard-cover-story?page=0%2C1">as billboard notes</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Self-help and astrological references abound on tracks like <em>Spiritual</em> and <em>Legendary Lovers,</em> reflecting Perry&#8217;s recent immersion in Transcendental Meditation and mindfulness therapy. Elsewhere, Perry pointedly confronts her turbulent recent history. The line &#8220;You sent a text/It&#8217;s like the wind changed your mind&#8221; from <em>Ghost</em> references how Brand delivered the news he wanted a divorce. <em>By the Grace of God,</em> meanwhile, begins with Perry lying on the floor of a bathroom, fighting suicidal thoughts. &#8220;That song is evident of how tough it really was at a certain point. I asked myself, &#8216;Do I want to endure? Should I continue living?&#8217;&#8221; Perry says. &#8220;All the songs are real-life moments. I can only write autobiographically. I put all the evidence in the music. I tell my fans if they want to know the real truth about stuff, just listen to the songs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>A few of the lyrics are particularly interesting:</p>

<blockquote><p>Thought I wasn&#8217;t enough<br/>
found I wasn&#8217;t so tough<br/>
Laying on the bathroom floor<br/>
We were living on a front line<br/>
and I felt the fault was all mine<br/>
Couldn&#8217;t take it anymore</p>

<p>By the grace of God<br/>
There was no other way<br/>
I picked myself back up<br/>
I knew I had to say<br/>
I put one foot in front of the other and I<br/>
Looked in the mirror and decided to stay<br/>
Wasn&#8217;t gonna let love take me out that way</p></blockquote>

<p>Love is a reference to her ex-husband Brand.</p>

<blockquote><p>I thank my sister for keeping my head above the water<br/>
When the truth was like swallowing sand<br/>
Now, every morning, oh there is no more morning<br/>
Oh, I can finally see myself again</p>

<p><strong>I know I am enough, possible to be loved</strong><br/>
It was not about me<br/>
Now I have to raise above<br/>
Let the Universe call the bluff<br/>
Yeah, <strong>the truth will set you free</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>The phrase <strong><em>the truth will set you free</em></strong> is a quote from Jesus speaking in John 8, leading many to speculate that this is a homage to her past as a singer in Christian contemporary music.</p>

<h3>Miley Cyrus</h3>

<p>When Destiny Hope Cyrus rose to fame after being cast in Disney&#8217;s Hannah Montanna, many were enamoured with the country singer&#8217;s daughter from the buckle of the bible belt. To add to her family friendly charm, she described her Christian faith as &#8221;<a href="http://www.parade.com/celebrity/2010/03/miley-cyrus.html">very important</a>&#8221; and wrote about keeping the faith in <em>The Climb</em>. Some even saw her as part of a new movement of conservative Christian public figures that would bring the US <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130703010527/http://conservapedia.com/Essay:The_Coming_Fifth_Great_Awakening_in_America">back to social conservatism in a new great awakening</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/cyrus-c.png" alt="Conservapedia praises Cyrus's Christianity" /></p>

<p>Cyrus in 2007 described her stardom as being &#8221;<a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-01-10-miley-cyrus_x.htm">God&#8217;s will</a>&#8221;, promising that she wouldn&#8217;t start going crazy under the spotlight.</p>

<blockquote><p>In a pop culture filled with young hot starlets gone wild, isn&#8217;t Billy Ray worried that pretty Miley will soon start doing nutty Britney Spears-eque things, like not wearing underpants?</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s never wore underwear,&#8221; Billy Ray says without missing a beat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad!&#8221; Miley says.</p></blockquote>

<p>Miley went on to present an increasingly edgy image, with most media outlets <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/let-me-explain-why-miley-cyrus-vma-performance-was,33632/">disproportionately covering her antics instead of actual news</a>. This is the <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/Qy8xE">latest controvertial act</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/cyrus.gif" alt="Cyrus VMA performance" /></p>

<p>Why would she do such a thing? Probably because Professor Lawrence Krauss has addled her brain:</p>

<p><img src="/images/cyrus-1.png" alt="Cyrus tweeting a beautiful quote from Lawrence Krauss" /></p>

<p>Sinead O&#8217;Connor wrote an <a href="http://www.sineadoconnor.com/2013/10/open-letter-to-miley-cyrus/">open letter to Cyrus, complaining that she regrets her record label pushing her to be too sexual</a>. Cyrus responded that she was <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/music/miley-to-sinead-im-too-busy--performing-and-hosting-on-tv-to-write-back-20131004-2uy8m.html">too busy to write back</a>, though the whole thing has turned ugly with mental health issues being discussed publicly.</p>

<p>Amanda Palmer weighed in, commenting that she finds some performers want to be sexually powerful on stage, and that <a href="http://amandapalmer.net/blog/20131003/">they themselves push to expose themselves more on stage</a>, noting:</p>

<blockquote><p>“It’s a Chinese finger trap that reflects the basic problems of our women-times: we’re either scolded for looking sexy or we’re scolded for not playing the game. Those who manage to find a perfect balance are rare, and the culture at large seems hellbent on undermining our ability to create that balance peacefully within ourselves. And weirdly, it’s generally women scolding other women…we’re our own worst enemies.”</p></blockquote>

<h3>Rhianna</h3>

<p>&#8220;Pour it up&#8221; is very much on the pro-sex side of the equation by making a song about stripping, and about half of the youtube votes are negative.</p>
