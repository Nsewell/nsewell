<div class="entry-content"><p>The pope has <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-23/pope-banishes-germany27s-bling-bishop-from-diocese/5041880">banished the &#8220;Bishop of Bling&#8221;</a> Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst over allegations of lying.</p>

<p>Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst announced that his diocean centre would cost 5.5 million euros in 2010, but the architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz-Peter_Tebartz-van_Elst">admitted that the true cost was known to be much higher from the start</a>, with plans for extravagant addons like half a million euros for art and 20,000 for a bathtub causing the project to blow out to 32 million euros. This came at a time when his staff were facing funding cuts because of a savings plan instituted a principle of austerity in the church.</p>

<p>The pope has <a href="http://michaeloloughlin.religionnews.com/2013/10/23/popes-financial-reforms/">instituted financial reforms</a> in the Vatican to encourage transparency and accountability, and to prevent money laundering. German dioceses are chafing under the new plans, which would reveal to their donors just how well-off they are.</p>

<p>As reported in the Religion News Service, German dioceses are among the world&#8217;s welthiest, and the diocese of Cologne is <a href="http://www.religionnews.com/2013/10/23/bishops-suspension-symptom-german-catholic-churchs-wealth/">richer than the Vatican</a>. By law, Germans registered as Catholics must give 8-10% of their tax revenue to the church, which gave the church $7.1 US billion in 2012. Even as over 100,000 members leave the church every year following child sex abuse scandals, the dioceses still have enormous asset reserves.</p>

<p>While the new Argentinian pope travells on a bus or in a donated 20 year old Renault his obstinate German subordinantes refuse to give up their BMWs and Audis. The previous pope took up a yearly collection of <a href="https://opentabernacle.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/popes-personal-income-200-million-annually/">$200 million US</a>, which will certainly guarantee him a comfortable life in retirement, while the new pope has opted to live in a single room in a guesthouse rather than his papal apartment.</p>

<blockquote><p>“The German Catholic Church is one of the country’s wealthiest and largest organizations and its top officials expect a certain lifestyle,” said Carsten Frerk, who has published two books on the German churches’ wealth and what he describes as their opaque financing. “But they are wary of the extent of their wealth becoming broadly known because it might lead to fewer donations.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Francis has commented that he <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/01/pope-francis-interview_n_4023659.html?utm_hp_ref=religion">dislikes careerist priests</a>, stating “It also happens to me that when I meet a clericalist, I suddenly become anti-clerical. Clericalism should not have anything to do with Christianity.”</p>

<p>Francis had stated in September that the Catholic Church was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24166434">too focussed on sexual issues</a> like homosexuality, abortion and contraception, and they must increase their focus on the poor and marginalised. This has apparently had little effect in the US, where the US Conference of Catholic Bishops <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/10/18/1248662/-Shutdown-losers-include-Catholic-Bishops">campaigned for Republicans to introduce religious priviliges</a> into the &#8216;must pass&#8217; resolution to end the government shutdown and avert a US government default. The shutdown cost 800,000 jobs and left poor families without food stamps for weeks, and resulted in the Republican party hitting the lowest approval rating of any political party recorded by Gallup. The government shutdown over Obamacare appears to be a <a href="http://thecontributor.com/religion/how-catholic-bishops-pushed-shutdown-%E2%80%93-and-even-default-%E2%80%93-over-birth-control">long-planned offensive from the USCCB</a>, with their opposition to Obamacare <a href="http://publicreligion.org/2012/08/as-catholics-go-so-goes-the-nation/">parroted by the Romney campaign</a>.</p>

<p>In Victoria, local communities are devastated that the Uniting Church is selling off between <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-17/730-anglican-church-story/5029694">$32 million</a> and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-11/uniting-church-puts-properties-up-for-sale-to-clear-debts/5015754">$100 million</a> worth of church properties to cover debts accumulated by the failure of Acacia College. The Church is considering selling <a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/north/ivanhoe-east-church-on-the-market-as-uniting-church-liquidates-properties/story-fnglenug-1226741089815">56 properties</a> after they had had run up $10 million dollars in debt because of legal issues with the developer, and <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-10-18/catholic-church-considers-buying-acacia-college/4321504">unexpected infrastructure costs</a>.</p>

<p>While megachurches like Hillsong make <a href="www.heraldsun.com.au/money/money-matters/tax-office-push-for-charity-monitoring/story-fn312ws8-1225896551630">over $50 million dollars a year in tax-free profits</a>, paying their leaders more than $1.5 million a year, most small churches founded on volunteerism and support for charities have their supporter base dying off, with none of the flashy showmanship that attracts rich idiots into the Pentecostal churches.</p>

<p>Many of the parishioners were shocked to find that the churches they had been volunteering in and donating to for years, and for some, decades, were soon to be sold off. This is not the first time that local churches have been asked to bear the brunt of financial losses after a central church body loses millions. The Sydney Anglican church lost over $100 million by <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/millions-wiped-out-by-church-gambles-20090609-c29m.html">borrowing money to invest in shares before the GFC in 2009</a>, leading it to ask parishioners to take part in a planned but now unfunded evangelical sabotage of the Bible Society&#8217;s Jesus All About Life campaign. In February the Los Angeles Catholic diocese, after having paid $660 million dollars to settle more than 500 child sexual abuse cases <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/deaconsbench/2013/02/los-angeles-considering-capital-campaign-to-raise-200-million/">asked their parishioners for $200 million</a> for &#8220;repair and upkeep of our parish churches and schools.&#8221; This is after they had already managed to misappropriate $115 million from a grave maintenance fund <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/wwjtd/2013/02/the-los-angeles-diocese-found-some-new-funds/">into paying off child sexual assault victims</a>, without the knowledge or consent of the donors.</p>

<p>Most religionists would be completely shocked to find that the religion they&#8217;ve been trying to follow is completely different to the religion that their leaders use to gain money and power.</p>

<h3>Wider resentment of Prosperity Theology</h3>

<p>While in Germany the revelation of lying, selfish preachers is a scandal, in the US it&#8217;s nothing new. Peter Popoff was making $4 million a year when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Popoff">James Randi exposed him as a fraud</a>, and Bobby Tilton may have made as much as $80 million a year when he was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Tilton">found to be dumping the prayer requests his ministry took donations for</a>. The new Reality TV show Preachers of LA shows the glitzy and glamorous lives of Ferrari and Bentley driving pastors who fully embrace Prosperity Theology. Bishop Ron Gibson, with whom he had a child out of wedlock, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/10406467/Meet-the-real-bishops-of-bling-the-Californian-preachers-of-prosperity-theology.html">boasts that fancy cars are not just for materialistic rappers</a></p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;P Diddy and Jay-Z - they&#8217;re not the only ones who should be driving Ferraris and living in large houses,&#8221; he says to the camera as he compares himself to secular celebrities. To whoops from his congregation, he notes: &#8220;You see my bling, you see my Bentley, you see my glory but you don&#8217;t see my story.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `[]&#8217; for nil:NilClass</p>

<p>Baptist Pastors have a long history of playing their parishioners for mugs. Mark Barclay, a self proclaimed &#8220;Preacher of Righteousness&#8221; recently asked his followers for $79,000 for a paint job on his private jet, saying &#8221;<a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/televangelist-asks-followers-for-79k-to-do-paint-job-on-lords-jet-he-bought-last-year-98435/">the airplane does belong to Him [God] and not me and is used for His ministry and not personal use</a>.&#8221; He had the gall to cite Jesus&#8217;s words &#8220;do not store up treasures for yourself&#8221; to justify why his members should &#8220;sow&#8221; offerings for his million dollar jet.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a growing tide of criticism of prosperity theology. In a statement, Professor Stanley Hauerwas denounced the $1.7 million home of pastor Steve Furtick saying &#8220;It&#8217;s just vulgar. It&#8217;s an offense to the Gospel.&#8221; A number of media outlets are criticising pastors with private jets in <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2220833/Laughing-private-jet--93m-pastor-accused-exploiting-British-worshippers.html">Nigeria</a> and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/andersonantunes/2013/01/17/the-richest-pastors-in-brazil/">Brazil</a>. A pastor who promised parishioners a miraculous new car if they would donate $52,000 for new blades for his private helicopter has lashed out at the media for publicizing the campaign, but not before widespread denunciation.</p>
