<div class="entry-content"><p>The pope has <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-23/pope-banishes-germany27s-bling-bishop-from-diocese/5041880">banished the &#8220;Bishop of Bling&#8221;</a> Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst over allegations of lying.</p>

<p>Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst announced that his diocean centre would cost 5.5 million euros in 2010, but the architect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz-Peter_Tebartz-van_Elst">admitted that the true cost was known to be much higher from the start</a>, with plans for extravagant addons like half a million euros for art and 20,000 for a bathtub causing the project to blow out to 32 million euros. This came at a time when his staff were facing funding cuts because of a savings plan instituted a principle of austerity in the church.</p>

<p>The pope has <a href="http://michaeloloughlin.religionnews.com/2013/10/23/popes-financial-reforms/">instituted financial reforms</a> in the Vatican to encourage transparency and accountability, and to prevent money laundering. German dioceses are chafing under the new plans, which would reveal to their donors just how well-off they are.</p>

<p>As reported in the Religion News Service, German dioceses are among the world&#8217;s welthiest, and the diocese of Cologne is <a href="http://www.religionnews.com/2013/10/23/bishops-suspension-symptom-german-catholic-churchs-wealth/">richer than the Vatican</a>. By law, Germans registered as Catholics must give 8-10% of their tax revenue to the church, which gave the church $7.1 US billion in 2012. Even as over 100,000 members leave the church every year following child sex abuse scandals, the dioceses still have enormous asset reserves.</p>

<p>While the new Argentinian pope travells on a bus or in a donated 20 year old Renault his obstinate German subordinantes refuse to give up their BMWs and Audis. The previous pope took up a yearly collection of <a href="https://opentabernacle.wordpress.com/2011/05/08/popes-personal-income-200-million-annually/">$200 million US</a>, which will certainly guarantee him a comfortable life in retirement, while the new pope has opted to live in a single room in a guesthouse rather than his papal apartment.</p>

<blockquote><p>“The German Catholic Church is one of the country’s wealthiest and largest organizations and its top officials expect a certain lifestyle,” said Carsten Frerk, who has published two books on the German churches’ wealth and what he describes as their opaque financing. “But they are wary of the extent of their wealth becoming broadly known because it might lead to fewer donations.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Francis has commented that he <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/01/pope-francis-interview_n_4023659.html?utm_hp_ref=religion">dislikes careerist priests</a>, stating “It also happens to me that when I meet a clericalist, I suddenly become anti-clerical. Clericalism should not have anything to do with Christianity.”</p>

<p>Francis had stated in September that the Catholic Church was <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24166434">too focussed on sexual issues</a> like homosexuality, abortion and contraception, and they must increase their focus on the poor and marginalised. This has apparently had little effect in the US, where the US Conference of Catholic Bishops <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/10/18/1248662/-Shutdown-losers-include-Catholic-Bishops">campaigned for Republicans to introduce religious priviliges</a> into the &#8216;must pass&#8217; resolution to end the government shutdown and avert a US government default. The shutdown cost 800,000 jobs and left poor families without food stamps for weeks, and resulted in the Republican party hitting the lowest approval rating of any political party recorded by Gallup. The government shutdown over Obamacare appears to be a <a href="http://thecontributor.com/religion/how-catholic-bishops-pushed-shutdown-%E2%80%93-and-even-default-%E2%80%93-over-birth-control">long-planned offensive from the USCCB</a>, with their opposition to Obamacare <a href="http://publicreligion.org/2012/08/as-catholics-go-so-goes-the-nation/">parroted by the Romney campaign</a>.</p>
