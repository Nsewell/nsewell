<div class="entry-content"><p>John Dickson, founder of the Centre for Public Christianity recently <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2013/07/08/3798272.htm">wrote in ABC religion and ethics</a> that he hates the atheist one-liner &#8220;There have been 10,000 gods through history, you reject 9,999 of them. I just go one god further!&#8221; He writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>It was a well-rehearsed line straight out of the atheist joke book - Dawkins likes to tell it, too. It got the laugh a witticism deserves. Simon replied laconically, &#8220;Is that meant to be an argument, Fitz?&#8221; Apparently, it was. &#8220;I&#8217;ve put this to a lot of believers over the years,&#8221; FitzSimons said with gusto, &#8220;and none of them has been able to reply.&#8221; I was surprised to hear that. So let me give it a go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Atheists just go one god further&#8221; is an aphorism regularly offered but rarely thought through. The idea it asks us to consider is something like this: when Christians reflect on why they reject Zeus, Ra, Isis, Vishnu et al., they will come to see the good sense of the atheist who simply adds one more deity to the rubbish bin. The arguments Christians employ against other gods, so the logic goes, come back to bite the Christian god as well. It is cute but silly.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Rubbish bin usually has the words &#8220;Don&#8217;t litter my mind.&#8221;</p>

<p><img src="/images/dickson.jpg" alt="Don't Litter my Mind" /></p>

<blockquote><p>For one thing, believers in any particular religion do not reject the other gods in toto. They deny the manifestations and stories of the other deities, but not necessarily their substance. A Christian may reject the elaborations and add-on characteristics of, say, Ra or Vishnu, but they happily acknowledge the wisdom of the ancient Egyptians and Indians in positing the existence of a powerful Intelligence which orders the universe.</p>

<p>There is, in other words, an irreducible shared conviction among most worshipers: the rational order of the universe is best explained by the existence of an almighty Mind (or Minds) behind it all. This is why the apostle Paul in Athens (Acts 17) can happily quote a line from a hymn to Zeus in his argument about God: &#8220;We are his offspring.&#8221; Paul did not think the stories about Zeus were true, but he agreed with the idea of divine power and intelligence which belief in Zeus embodied. Fitz and others are simply misguided to liken a Christian&#8217;s rejection of particular versions of divinity with the atheist&#8217;s denial of divinity altogether.</p></blockquote>

<p>Paul of Tarsus quotes Aratus and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimenides_paradox">Epimenides the Cretan</a> in Acts 17:28 and Titus 1:12.</p>

<blockquote><p>An analogy highlights the error. In choosing to marry my wife, it is true that I rejected all other potential spouses (not that there were that many). Does this mean I have rejected the idea at the core of other people&#8217;s marriages? Of course not. But imagine a zealous celibate, who rejected marriage altogether and tried to use my own decision to marry one person as an argument against matrimony itself: &#8220;When you consider why you rejected other women in favour of her, then you will see the good sense of rejecting marriage altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>I hardly need to point out that the difference between committed marriage and deliberate celibacy is not one of degree. Rejecting particular partners is nothing like rejecting the idea of partnership altogether. The analogy isn&#8217;t perfect but it makes one point clear: &#8220;we atheists just go one god further&#8221; is no more compelling than &#8220;we celibates just go one partner further.&#8221;</p>

<p>A believer&#8217;s denial of particular manifestations of the divine offers no support whatsoever for the atheist&#8217;s rejection of divinity itself. One-liners like this from the 101 Jokes for Atheists book should indeed be the object of laughter.</p></blockquote>

<p>The reason why people make these jokes is not because of the number of deities in the world, but how far reason and science has taken us away from the superstition that created them.</p>

<p>If you believe that Christianity is true and other religions are false, ask yourself a few questions:</p>

<p>Is the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=josh10.10-15&amp;version=NET">book of Joshua</a> any less wrong about heliocentrism than the belief that Ra drives a chariot of fire across the sky? If Christian views on cosmology, inspired by a literal reading of the book of Joshua weren&#8217;t threatened by heliocentrism, then why did Catholic inquisitors force Galileo to recant his scientific theories and die under house arrest?</p>

<p>If Mithraism is false, why did Justin Martyr and Tertullian see a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ_in_comparative_mythology">similarity between Mithraic initiation ceremonies and Christian Eucharist</a>?</p>

<p>Why does the Ancient Egyptian idea of eternal damnation in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_of_Fire">lake of fire</a> for those whose hearts are too heavy with sin predate the Chrisitan idea of salvation from eternal punishment in a lake of molten sulfur? Why do the 42 Negative Confessions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maat">Maat</a> pre-date <a href="http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_10cl.htm">the 10 commandments</a>? Why does Job&#8217;s <a href="http://bookofjob.org/act2.htm">Oath of Innocence</a>(Job 31) sound like a mirror immage of the negative confession?</p>

<p><img src="/images/maat-feather2.jpg" alt="Ancient Egyptian depiction of the weighing of a soul" /></p>

<p>If Osiris is a made up god, then why does Yahweh introduce Jesus as &#8220;This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.&#8221;(<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matt17.5&amp;version=NET">Matt 17:5</a>) when Osiris is introduced as &#8221;<a href="http://www.egyptorigins.org/osirisandjesusII.htm">I say by Nut, the brilliant, the great: This is my son, my first-born, opener of my womb; this is my beloved, with whom I am pleased</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>If there is only one God, Yahweh, why does he insist in the first commandment, &#8221;<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ex20&amp;version=NET">You shall have no other gods before me</a>&#8221; ? Did Judaism evolve from a polytheistic Caananite religion? Why does the Torah use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton">tetragrammaton</a> YHWH interchangably with the older Caananite word for the leader of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_(deity">polytheistic pantheon, El</a>)? If El is not a real god, then why do the Jewish people (Yiśrāʾ ēl, those who wrestle with god) use the same word for their god?</p>

<p>Why does Psalm 82:1 say &#8221;<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ps82.1&amp;version=NET">God stands in the assembly of El, in the midst of the gods he renders judgment</a>&#8220;(NET bible) if the polytheistic El (with his divine assembly) is made up?</p>

<p>One of the most important figures int he Old Testament, Moses, appears to have much in common with the myths of other deities. His story of being put in an ark of bullrushes (same hebrew word as Noah&#8217;s ark) is <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/mbh/index.htm">similar to the stories of heroes</a> like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad">Sargon of Akkad</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karna">Karna</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great">Cyrus</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus_and_Remus">Romulus</a></p>

<p>Was the miracle of Moses dividing the waters of the Sea of Reeds inspired by Egyptian stories of magic. The fictional magician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djadjaemankh">Djadjaemankh</a> was rumoured to be able to fold a body of water in half. The story starts with the pharaoh <a href="http://www.thekeep.org/~kunoichi/kunoichi/themestream/egypt_magic.html">Snefru being bored</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;&#8230;His majesty said to him: [&#8216;I have gone through all the rooms] of the palace in search of relaxation and found none.&#8217; Djadjaemankh said to him: &#8216;May your majesty proceed to the lake of the palace. Fill a boat with all the beautiful girls of your palace. Your majesty&#8217;s heart will be refreshed by seeing them row, a rowing up and down. As you observe the fine nesting places of your lake, as you observe its beautiful fields and shores, your heart will be refreshed by it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Said his majesty: &#8216;Indeed, I shall go boating! Let there be brought to me twenty oars of ebony plated with gold, their handles of sandalwood plated with electrum. Let there be brought to me twenty women with the shapeliest bodies, breasts, and braids, who have not yet given birth. Also let there be brought to me twenty nets and give these nets to these women in place of their clothes!&#8217; All was done as his majesty commanded.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Wanting a beautiful maiden brought to him also has some parallels with King David, but that could just be that it makes sense to cast ancient kings as creeps. While the king is making his heart glad perving on the beautiful virgins, they stop:</p>

<blockquote><p>And so they row to and fro and Sneferu&#8217;s heart is gladdened when he sees the girls row. Then it happens that the stroke maiden goes through her braids with her fingers and a hair pendant in the shape of a fish, made of malachite, falls into the water of the lake. The stroke maiden becomes silent in shock and grief and stops specifying the clock. Her complete line of rowers becomes silent, too, and they all stop rowing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Snefru wants to make the stroke maiden happy and offers her a new fish pendant, but she refuses, demanding the recovery of the original. The story goes on with magic division of the lake:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Djadjaemankh utters a secret spell which makes the waters of the lake move, so that one half side of the lake now rests on the other half. The water which had been 12 cubits in height becomes now 24 cubits at one side, whilst the other side is dry now. Djadjaemankh enters the lake&#8217;s ground and picks up the lost fish-pendant, which was lying on a pot-shard. He brings the amulet back to the stroke maiden and then removes the waters magically back to their original positions.</p></blockquote>

<p>Does this sound at all like Moses dividing water with magic powers, walking on dry ground, and then letting the water flow back again? The birth story of Moses being protected in an ark of bullrushes has similarities to the birth narrative of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad">Sargon</a>.</p>

<p>The burden of proof on Christian believers is not just to prove that their deity exists, but also that the claims they make about their god are substantially different to older polytheistic deities now dismissed as unscientific myths.</p>

<p>Aron Ra gives further examples of the myths similar to the Torah myths:</p>
