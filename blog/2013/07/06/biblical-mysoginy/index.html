<div class="entry-content"><p>Whether it&#8217;s saying that it&#8217;s God&#8217;s will that women get pregnant from rape, or that women can&#8217;t get pregnant from &#8221;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_and_pregnancy_controversies_in_United_States_elections,_2012">legitimate rape</a>&#8221; because women can &#8220;shut that whole thing down&#8221;, Republican senators seem to be living on another planet when they talk about women. One street preacher, proud to be a virgin, declares that women at a Take Back The Night march on <a href="http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/348898">his campus deserve to be raped</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/deserve-rape.jpg" alt="You Deserve Rape sign" /></p>

<p>While his pro rape trolling is crazy by modern standards, it&#8217;s sadly not far outside Christian tradition for much of the last 2000 years.
Dr Valerie Tarico has compiled a list of <a href="http://awaypoint.wordpress.com/2013/07/01/mysogynistquoteschurchfathers/">vile quotes from church fathers thoughout history teaching their flock to hate women</a></p>

<blockquote><p>What with diatribes about entertainers who <a href="http://www.leftfootforward.org/2013/06/daily-mail-columnist-says-rihannas-fashion-sense-invites-rape/">invite rape</a>
and moms who are <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/psysociety/2013/06/03/fox-news-fact-check-is-it-bad-for-lower-income-kids-if-mom-has-a-job-outside-the-home/">destroying America</a>
by supporting their families &#8230; with ignorant arguments about
<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2013/06/18/rep_mike_burgess_of_texas_suggests_banning_abortion_because_fetuses_masturbate.html">fetuses that masturbate</a>,
and females who might as well <a href="http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/contracepting-america-the-real-war-on-women">if they use contraception</a>,
and fetal personhood that trumps the personhood of females &#8230; . it’s
tempting to think that Christian conservatives, have reached some new
pinnacle of hating women and sexuality. But the sad reality is that even
the media’s most unabashed misogynists like Michelle Bachman, Michael
Burgess, Lou Dobbs or Juan Williams are actually tame compared to their
ideological ancestors, which include some of the biggest names in
Christian history.</p>

<p>In past centuries, men who were hailed as Church Fathers, Patriarchs,
Doctors, and even Saints boldly expressed their view that females are
inferior and loathsome; and they explained at length why God shared
their perspective. Lest we fall into the <em>conservative</em> trap of thinking
that the past was somehow better than the nasty messes we face today,
it’s worth pondering some of the lovely tidbits that the Church has
thought fit to preserve and promote in the centuries since Christianity
was founded. Here are some of the most savory. They come from three
waves of religious leaders: “Fathers” of the Catholic Church, Protestant
Reformers, and American patriarchs who inherited the mantle of both.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Church Doctors and Fathers</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Woman is a temple built over a sewer.
<strong>–</strong><em>Tertullian, “the father of Latin Christianity” (c160-225)</em></p></li>
<li><p>In pain shall you bring forth children, woman, and you shall turn to
your husband and he shall rule over you. And do you not know that
you are Eve? God’s sentence hangs still over all your sex and His
punishment weighs down upon you. You are the devil’s gateway; you
are she who first violated the forbidden tree and broke the law of
God. It was you who coaxed your way around him whom the devil had
not the force to attack. With what ease you shattered that image of
God: Man! Because of the death you merited, even the Son of God had
to die… <strong>Woman, you are the gate to hell</strong>.
<strong>–</strong><em>Tertullian, “the father of Latin Christianity” (c160-225)</em></p></li>
<li><p>[Women&#8217;s] very consciousness of their own nature must evoke feelings
of shame.–<em>Saint Clement of Alexandria, Christian theologian (c150-215) Pedagogues II, 33, 2</em></p></li>
<li><p>Nor are the women to smear their faces with the ensnaring devices of
wily cunning&#8230; The Instructor [Christ] orders them to go forth
“in becoming apparel, and adorn themselves with shamefacedness and
sobriety, subject to their own husbands.”
–<em>Saint Clement of Alexandria, Christian theologian (c150-215), <a href="http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/clement-instructor-book3.html">The Instructor</a></em></p></li>
<li><p>For it is improper for a woman to speak in an assembly, no matter
what she says,
even if she says admirable things, or even saintly things, that is
of little
consequence, since they come from the mouth of a woman.
<em><strong>–</strong>Origen (d. 258), </em>Fragments on First Corinthians<em>, 74</em></p></li>
<li><p>Woman does not possess the image of God in herself but only when
taken together
 with the male who is her head, so that the whole substance is one
image. But
 when she is assigned the role as helpmate, a function that pertains
to her
 alone, then she is not the image of God. But as far as the man is
concerned, he
 is by himself alone the image of God just as fully and completely
as when he and
 the woman are joined together into one. –<em>Saint Augustine, Bishop
of Hippo Regius (354-430)</em></p></li>
<li><p>What is the difference whether it is in a wife or a mother, it is
still Eve the temptress that we must beware of in any woman… I fail
to see what use woman can be to man, if one excludes the function of
bearing children. <em>–Saint Augustine, Bishop of Hippo Regius (354 –
430)</em></p></li>
<li><p>To embrace a woman is to embrace a sack of manure. - Odo of Cluny stated</p></li>
<li><p>Woman is a misbegotten man and has a faulty and defective nature in
comparison to his. Therefore she is unsure in herself. What she
cannot get, she seeks to obtain through lying and diabolical
deceptions. And so, to put it briefly, one must be on one’s guard
with every woman, as if she were a poisonous snake and the horned
devil. … Thus in evil and perverse doings woman is cleverer, that
is, slyer, than man. Her feelings drive woman toward every evil,
just as reason impels man toward all good. <em>–Saint Albertus Magnus,
Dominican theologian, 13th century</em></p></li>
<li><p>As regards the individual nature, woman is defective and
misbegotten, for the active force in the male seed tends to the
production of a perfect likeness in the masculine sex; while the
production of woman comes from a defect in the active force or from
some material indisposition, or even from some external influence.
<em>–Thomas Aquinas, Doctor of the Church, 13th century, Summa Theologica</em></p></li>
<li><p>All witchcraft comes from carnal lust, which is in women insatiable. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleus_Maleficarum">Malleus Maleficarum</a>, 1486</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Protestant Reformers</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>The word and works of God is quite clear, that women were made
either to be wives or prostitutes. –<em>Martin Luther, Works 12.94</em></p></li>
<li><p>Men have broad and large chests, and small narrow hips, and more
understanding than women, who have but small and narrow breasts, and
broad hips, to the end they should remain at home, sit still, keep
house, and bear and bring up children. –<em>Martin Luther, Table Talk</em></p></li>
<li><p>No gown worse becomes a woman than the desire to be wise. -<em>Martin Luther</em></p></li>
<li><p>Even though they grow weary and wear themselves out with child-bearing, it does not matter; let them go on bearing children till they die, that is what they are there for. <em>Martin Luther, Works 20.84</em></p></li>
<li><p>God created Adam master and lord of living creatures, but Eve spoilt all, when she persuaded him to set himself above God&#8217;s will. &#8216;Tis you women, with your tricks and artifices, that lead men into error. -<em>Martin Luther</em></p></li>
<li><p>We may well lie with what seems to be a woman of flesh and blood, and yet all the time it is only a devil in the shape of a woman. -<em>Martin Luther</em></p></li>
<li><p>“If a woman grows weary and at last dies from childbearing, it matters not. Let her only die from bearing; she is there to do it.” —<em>Martin Luther</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Thus the woman, who had perversely exceeded her proper bounds, is
forced back to her own position. She had, indeed, previously been
subject to her husband, but that was a liberal and gentle
subjection; now, however, she is cast into servitude.<strong>–</strong><em>John
Calvin, Reformer (1509-1564), Commentary on Genesis, p. 172.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Do not any longer contend for mastery, for power, money, or praise.
Be content to be a private, insignificant person, known and loved by
God and me&#8230; . of what importance is your character to mankind,
if you was buried just now Or if you had never lived, what loss
would it be to the cause of God.<strong>–</strong><em>John Wesley, founder of
Methodist movement (1703-1791), <a href="http://wesley.nnu.edu/john-wesley/the-letters-of-john-wesley/wesleys-letters-1774/">letter to his wife</a>,
July 15, 1774</em></p></li>
</ul>


<h3>American Patriarchs (Puritan, Mormon, Baptist, Evangelical)</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Even as the church must fear Christ Jesus, so must the wives also
fear their husbands. And this inward fear must be shewed by an
outward meekness and lowliness in her speeches and carriage to her
husband&#8230; . For if there be not fear and reverence in the
inferior, there can be no sound nor constant honor yielded to the
superior. –<em>John Dod, A Plaine and Familiar Exposition of the Ten
Commandements</em>, <em>Puritan guidebook first published in 1603</em>**</p></li>
<li><p>The second duty of the wife is constant obedience and subjection.
–<em>John Dod, A Plaine and Familiar Exposition of the Ten
Commandements</em>, <em>Puritan guidebook first published in 1603</em>**</p></li>
<li><p>The root of masculine is stronger, and of feminine weaker. The sun
is a governing planet to certain planets, while the moon borrows her
light from the sun, and is less or weaker. <em>–Joseph Smith, founder
of LDS movement (1805-1844), History of the Church, V, p. 211</em></p></li>
<li><p>Women are made to be led, and counseled, and directed&#8230; . And if
I am not a good man, I have no just right in this Church to a wife
or wives, or the power to propagate my species. What then should be
done with me? Make a eunuch of me, and stop my propagation. <em>–Heber
C. Kimball, venerated early LDS apostle (1801-1868), JD 5:29</em></p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Modern mysogninists</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>A wife is to submit graciously to the servant leadership of her
husband, even as the church willingly submits to the headship of
Christ. <em>–Official Faith and Message Statement of Southern Baptist
Convention, Summer 1998, (15.7 million members)</em></p></li>
<li><p>The feminist agenda is not about equal rights for women. It is about
a socialist, anti-family political movement that encourages women to
leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft,
destroy capitalism and become lesbians. — <em>Pat Robertson, Southern
Baptist leader (1930-), <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1992/08/26/us/robertson-letter-attacks-feminists.html">fundraising
letter</a>
July 1992</em></p></li>
<li><p>The Holiness of God is not evidenced in women when they are brash,
brassy, boisterous, brazen, head-strong, strong-willed,
loud-mouthed, overly-talkative, having to have the last word,
challenging, controlling, manipulative, critical, conceited,
arrogant, aggressive, assertive, strident, interruptive,
undisciplined, insubordinate, disruptive, dominating, domineering,
or clamoring for power. Rather, women accept God’s holy order and
character by being humbly and unobtrusively respectful and receptive
in functional subordination to God, church leadership, and husbands.
<em>–James Fowler, Women in the Church, 1999</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Women will be saved by going back to that role that God has chosen
for them. Ladies, if the hair on the back of your neck stands up it
is because you are fighting your role in the scripture. <em>–<a href="http://community.feministing.com/2010/06/23/mark-driscoll-misogyny-and-masculinity/">Mark Driscoll</a>,
founder of Mars Hill nondenominational mega-church franchise.
(1970-), <a href="http://lineout.thestranger.com/2008/04/everclear_to_play_mars_hill_church">sermon 2008</a></em></p></li>
<li><p>Without blushing, Paul is simply stating that when it comes to leading in the church, women are unfit because they are more gullible and easier to deceive than men. While many irate women have disagreed with his assessment through the years, it does appear from this that such women who fail to trust his instruction and follow his teaching are much like their mother Eve and are well-intended but ill-informed &#8211;Driscoll</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Michael and Debi Pearl are advocates of extreme physical discipline and female submission. Their book to train up a child encourages physical violence against childen as young as 6 months to &#8220;break their spirit.&#8221; Michael advocates that fathers have fun disciplining hitting their children:</p>

<p>Debi Pearl has published a long exposition of her Christian version of Stockholm Syndrome called <a href="http://eaandfaith.blogspot.com.au/2008/04/debi-pearls-created-to-be-helpmate.html">Created to be his helpmeet</a>. It encourages women in abusive relationships to submit to violent partners:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Page 263: “Lady, you were created to give glory to God. When God puts you in
subjection to a man whom he knows is going to cause you to suffer, it is with
the understanding that <strong>you are obeying God by enduring the wrongful suffering</strong>.
And when you suffer wrongfully, as unto the Lord, you bring great glory to God
in heaven.”</p></li>
<li><p>Page 263: “Has your husband reviled and threatened you? You are exhorted to respond as Jesus did. When he was reviled and threatened, he suffered by
committing himself to a higher judge who is righteous. You must commit yourself
to the one who placed you under your husband’s command. Your husband will answer
to God, and you must answer to God for how you respond to your husband, even
when he causes you to suffer.”</p></li>
<li><p>Page 264: “You can freely call your husband “lord” when you know that you are addressing the one who put him in charge and asked you to suffer at your
husband’s hands just as our Lord suffered at the hands of unjust authorities… I
know that this must be an amazing doctrine to many of you. Nonetheless, it is no
less radical than Jesus was radical, and it is God’s way.”</p></li>
<li><p>Page 265: “For the eyes of the Lord see all that take place. His ears are open to your prayers when you obey him and obey your husband. And then comes the
promise: if you are following God, no harm will come to you by doing what is
good… You will receive a blessing when you suffer for righteousness’ sake, that
is, when you obey God by obeying your husband and not returning evil for evil.
You will be happy, so don’t be afraid or troubled by the things you must
endure.”</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Dr Tarico concludes:</p>

<blockquote><p>Why has the main current of Christianity produced a steady diet of
misogyny for over 2000 years? The answer may lay partly in human biology
and culture. But it also lies in the Iron Age texts of the Bible itself.
The Judeo-Christian tradition of building up men by tearing down women
goes all the way back to the most ancient parts of the biblical
collection, to the opening pages of Genesis, and continues unabated
through the New Testament. (I’ve written elsewhere about <a href="http://awaypoint.wordpress.com/2012/03/09/15-bible-texts-reveal-why-gods-own-party-is-at-war-with-women/">15 of those Bible verses</a>
because they partly explain the conservative assault on women.) As Mr.
Driscoll <a href="http://lineout.thestranger.com/2008/04/everclear_to_play_mars_hill_church">likes to</a>
remind his followers, “Every single book in your Bible is written by a
man.”</p></blockquote>
