<div class="youtube-lazy-link-info">The Great Debate: Marshall vs. Zuckerman (Christianity vs. Secular Humanism)</div>
</a>
<div class="video-info" >Does Christianity or secular humanism provide a better foundation for civil society? That is the question that is going to addressed between two scholars, Dr. David Marshall and Dr. Phillip Zuckerman, a Christian and an atheist.

David Marshall is the founder and director of the Kuai Mu Institute for Christianity and World Cultures, and the author of four books, including The Truth Behind the New Atheism: Responding to the Emerging Challenges to God and Christianity (Harvest House Publishers).

Phil Zuckerman is a professor of sociology and secular studies at Pitzer College in Claremont, CA. He is the author most recently of Faith No More: Why People Reject Religion (Oxford University Press, 2011) and Society Without God (NYU Press, 2008).</div>
</div>


<p>Zuckerman stuck to the facts about why largely secular post-Chrsitian societies around the world are doing better on most indicators than the most religious societies, while Marshall presented weak anecdotes of individual conversion experiences and straw men about how communists and vikings are bad people. The pastor of the church said &#8220;It just didn&#8217;t go the way we wanted it to go. We were not represented well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zuckerman has noted that many European societies that score well on social indicators also have <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/170356660/Phil-Zuckerman">low rates of Chrsitian belief</a>. Only 18% of Swedes believe in heaven, 10% believe in hell and 3% believe that the Bible is the literal word of God, among the lowest rates in the world. In Denmark, women&#8217;s labour force participation doubled in the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s, rapidly changing the model of femininity valued by young women. Social changes like these supported by neoliberal governments, including the banning of prosletyzing in schools, and the provision of free healthcare to all have quickly caused generational decline in religion as the state Lutheran church struggles to market itself.</p>

<p>Zuckerman eloquently criticised the bible belt states for high rates of divorce, teen pregnancy, sexual assault, diabetes, child abuse, unemployment and murder. He has a long history of criticising the political hypocrisy of the white evangelical power base, that claims evolution is wrong, but <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/phil-zuckerman/why-evangelicals-hate-jes_b_830237.html">tend to support policies that could be described as &#8220;Social Darwinism.&#8221;</a></p>

<blockquote><p>The results from a recent poll <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/Politics-and-Elections/Tea-Party-and-Religion.aspx">published by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life</a> reveal what social scientists have known for a long time: White Evangelical Christians are the group least likely to support politicians or policies that reflect the actual teachings of Jesus.</p></blockquote>

<p>Zuckerman has an excellent analysis of the <a href="http://www.edge.org/conversation/why-the-gods-are-not-winning">global decline of faith</a> on Edge.org. One interesting fact about the general decline of Chrstianity in America is how gender plays a factor in mixed faith households:</p>

<blockquote><p>Rather than Amerofaith becoming deeply patriarchal as Longman thinks, it is increasingly feminine. Women church goers greatly outnumber men, who find church too dull. Here&#8217;s the kicker. Children tend to pick up their beliefs from their fathers. So, despite a vibrant evangelical youth cohort, young Americans taken as a whole are the least religious and most culturally tolerant age group in the nation.</p></blockquote>

<p>He notes that the well resourced churches are consolidating believers rather than expanding the faithful</p>

<blockquote><p>Even the megachurch phenomenon is illusory. A spiritual cross of sports stadiums with theme parks, hi-tech churches are a desperate effort to pull in and satisfy a mass-media jaded audience for whom the old sit in the pews and listen to the standard sermon and sing some old time hymns does not cut it anymore. Rather than boosting church membership, megachurches are merely consolidating it.</p></blockquote>

<p>While Zuckerman notes that he was well remunerated for travelling to take part in the professionally recorded debate, the decision of the church to initially refuse to publish the video demonstrates that content matters more than its presentation. The trend of religion being on the nose for the last hundred years will continue as churches struggle to cover up their mistakes in an age of social media, no matter how well they learn to speak with &#8216;Gen Y&#8217;.</p>
