<div class="entry-content"><p>This bullshit has been going around on Facebook:</p>

<blockquote><p>Very insightful and very true&#8230;.Take a second to read this:</p>

<p>Apparently the White House referred to Christmas Trees as “Holiday Trees” for the first time this year which prompted CBS presenter, Ben Stein, to present this piece which I would like to share with you. I think it applies just as much to many countries as it does to America &#8230;</p>

<p>The following was written by Ben Stein and recited by him on CBS Sunday Morning Commentary.</p>

<p>My confession:</p>

<p>I am a Jew, and every single one of my ancestors was Jewish. And it does not bother me even a little bit when people call those beautiful lit up, bejewelled trees, Christmas trees. I don&#8217;t feel threatened. I don&#8217;t feel discriminated against. That&#8217;s what they are, Christmas trees.</p></blockquote>

<p>Stein loves to wear Judaism on his shoulder, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stein#Dominique_Strauss-Kahn">likening Obama and all proponents of science education as Nazis</a>. Talking about his &#8220;intelligent design&#8221; propaganda movie Stien said &#8220;Love of God and compassion and empathy leads you to a very glorious place, and science leads you to killing people.&#8221; The Anti-Defamation League issued a statement condemning the film&#8217;s misuse of the Holocaust and its imagery, &#8220;Using the Holocaust in order to tarnish those who promote the theory of evolution is outrageous and trivializes the complex factors that led to the mass extermination of European Jewry&#8221;.</p>

<blockquote><p>It doesn&#8217;t bother me a bit when people say, “Merry Christmas” to me. I don&#8217;t think they are slighting me or getting ready to put me in a ghetto. In fact, I kind of like it. It shows that we are all brothers and sisters celebrating this happy time of year. It doesn&#8217;t bother me at all that there is a manger scene on display at a key intersection near my beach house in Malibu. If people want a crib, it&#8217;s just as fine with me as is the Menorah a few hundred yards away.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whether he personally likes Christian imagery in public has no bearing on whether it is constitutional to use government money or government property to put up religious displays.</p>

<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t like getting pushed around for being a Jew, and I don&#8217;t think Christians like getting pushed around for being Christians. I think people who believe in God are sick and tired of getting pushed around, period. I have no idea where the concept came from, that America is an explicitly atheist country. I can&#8217;t find it in the Constitution and I don&#8217;t like it being shoved down my throat.</p></blockquote>

<p>Stein misrepresents the first amendment, which clearly states &#8220;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion&#8221;. This means that public money and public property cannot be used to establish a church, and cannot be used to promote any one religion. That&#8217;s why there are no prayers in US public schools, and no ten commandments in US courthouses.</p>

<blockquote><p>Or maybe I can put it another way: where did the idea come from that we should worship celebrities and we aren&#8217;t allowed to worship God? I guess that&#8217;s a sign that I&#8217;m getting old, too. But there are a lot of us who are wondering where these celebrities came from and where the America we knew went to.</p></blockquote>

<p>Separation of church and state doesn&#8217;t prevent any individual from practicing their religion or worshipping any God. It just means that the government isn&#8217;t allowed to insist to Hindu students that they must worship and Abrahamic God (&#8220;You shall have no other Gods except me&#8221;). The idea that the &#8220;America we knew&#8221; was a better place is a classic argument of conservatives, and is simply false, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect">the highest IQ on average ever</a>, and the <a href="http://edge.org/conversation/mc2011-history-violence-pinker">lowest rates of crime and violence ever</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>In light of the many jokes we send to one another for a laugh, this is a little different: This is not intended to be a joke; it&#8217;s not funny, it&#8217;s intended to get you thinking.</p>

<p>Billy Graham&#8217;s daughter was interviewed on the Early Show and Jane Clayson asked her: “How could God let something like this happen?” (regarding Hurricane Katrina). Anne Graham gave an extremely profound and insightful response. She said: “I believe God is deeply saddened by this, just as we are, but for years we&#8217;ve been telling God to get out of our schools, to get out of our government and to get out of our lives. And being the gentleman He is, I believe He has calmly backed out. How can we expect God to give us His blessing and His protection if we demand He leave us alone?”</p></blockquote>

<p>Jesus makes it clear that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Siloam">tragedy and calamity is not divine retribution</a>. Lotz said exactly the <a href="http://www.prayerfoundation.org/billy_grahams_daughter.htm">same unbiblical shit after 9/11</a>. Bryan Fisher said the same thing after the Conneticuit shooting:</p>

<div class="video-info" >http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/fischer-god-didnt-stop-ct-school-shooting-because-hes-gentleman-who-doesnt-go-where-he-not-w

Bryan Fischer explains that the massacre at a Connecticut elementary school could have been stopped by God, but he has been kicked out of public schools and doesn&#8217;t go where he is not wanted.</div>
</div>


<blockquote><p>In light of recent events&#8230; terrorists attack, school shootings, etc. I think it started when Madeleine Murray O&#8217;Hare (she was murdered, her body found a few years ago) complained she didn&#8217;t want prayer in our schools, and we said OK. Then someone said you better not read the Bible in school. The Bible says thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, and love your neighbour as yourself. And we said OK.</p></blockquote>

<p>The American government did not say &#8220;OK&#8221; to one woman&#8217;s demands. They followed the US constitution, and removed any material in <em>public</em> schools that would represent an establishment of religion, which forces students to comply with a set religion. Students are allowed to pray in student-initiated prayers, but cannot be directed or compelled to pray by teachers. Teachers are allowed to read from the bible and discuss it as literature in lessons such as history.</p>

<p>One of the key features of a secular system of law and order is that nobody is above the law, it applies equally to all people. That means that a crime committed against someone you don&#8217;t like is a crime, and still deserves justice. When someone you don&#8217;t like is arrested, they still have the right to a fair trial and a legal defence. Murder is murder and will be punished by secular law whether the ten commandments are in schools or courthouses, or not, or the accused or the victim is a religious believer or not. To suggest otherwise suggests delighting in tragedy of people you hate, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_the_other_cheek">you might just remember Jesus preaching against</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Then Dr. Benjamin Spock said we shouldn&#8217;t spank our children when they misbehave, because their little personalities would be warped and we might damage their self-esteem (Dr. Spock&#8217;s son committed suicide). We said an expert should know what he&#8217;s talking about. And we said okay.</p></blockquote>

<p>Pulling out anecdotes of suffering reeks of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude">Schadenfreude</a>, and says nothing about whether the self-esteem movement is useful or not.</p>

<blockquote><p>Now we&#8217;re asking ourselves why our children have no conscience, why they don&#8217;t know right from wrong, and why it doesn&#8217;t bother them to kill strangers, their classmates, and themselves.</p>

<p>Probably, if we think about it long and hard enough, we can figure it out. I think it has a great deal to do with &#8216;WE REAP WHAT WE SOW.&#8217;</p>

<p>Funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world&#8217;s going to hell. Funny how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what the Bible says. Funny how you can send &#8216;jokes&#8217; through e-mail and they spread like wildfire, but when you start sending messages regarding the Lord, people think twice about sharing. Funny how lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene articles pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion of God is suppressed in the school and workplace.</p></blockquote>

<p>Because unlike what the religious right thinks, &#8220;freedom of religion&#8221; does not mean &#8221;<a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/does-randy-forbes-understand-how-first-amendment-works">nobody is allowed to criticise me</a>&#8221;. Most people who post this kind of content will go through life thinking that most people hate them for their religion. But when Christians go arond with a self-righteous phariseeism trying to criticise, blame and haras anyone who doesn&#8217;t agree with them (including people from their own faith), the real reason they&#8217;re hated is because they&#8217;re a douchebag.</p>
