<div class="entry-content"><p>Paul Graham in 2009 <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html">noted that many discussions about religion and politics quickly stir up emotion in people</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>As a rule, any mention of religion on an online forum degenerates into a religious argument. Why? Why does this happen with religion and not with Javascript or baking or other topics people talk about on forums?</p>

<p>&#8230;Then it struck me: this is the problem with politics too. Politics, like religion, is a topic where there&#8217;s no threshold of expertise for expressing an opinion. All you need is strong convictions.</p></blockquote>

<p>Graham notes that discussions about a Bronze age war rarely devolve to political arguments, whereas modern conflicts that involve citizens of one&#8217;s country often do. He concludes:</p>

<blockquote><p>If people can&#8217;t think clearly about anything that has become part of their identity, then all other things being equal, the best plan is to let as few things into your identity as possible.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the greatest reasons that humans have dominated the entire planet is our ability to collaborate with non-kin groups. Many people refer to others in the same religion, nationality or political group as their brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>Psychologists have demonstrated cultural polarisation based on the affiliation with social institutions. Kahan writes in <strong><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1630002">Fixing the communications failure</a></strong>:</p>

<blockquote><p>In a famous 1950s psychology experiment, researchers showed students from two Ivy League colleges a film of an American football game between their schools in which officials made a series of controversial decisions against one side. Asked to make their own assessments, students who attended the offending team&#8217;s college reported seeing half as many illegal plays as did students from the opposing institution. Group ties, the researchers concluded, had unconsciously motivated students from both colleges to view the tape in a manner that favoured their own school.</p>

<p>Since then, a growing body of work has suggested that ordinary citizens react to scientific evidence on societal risks in much the same way. People endorse whichever position reinforces their connection to others with whom they share important commitments. As a result, public debate about science is strikingly polarized. The same groups who disagree on &#8216;cultural issues&#8217; — abortion, same-sex marriage and school prayer — also disagree on whether climate change is real and on whether underground disposal of nuclear waste is safe.</p></blockquote>

<p>Kahan and his colleagues have identified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_cognition">a range of issues where perceived clashes with cultural values of a particular group polarise opinion</a>.</p>

<p>Some people that retire after working in a job for decades, say as an accountant, will volunteer one day a week for a charity because the question &#8220;what do you do?&#8221; is often the second thing that people are asked.</p>

<p>Personally, I think that the strength of social identity is a strong reason why the <strong>No True Scotsman</strong> fallacy frequently comes up in political and religious arguments. It goes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman">like this</a></p>

<blockquote><p> Person A: No democracy ever starts a war<br/>
 Person B: Well country X is a democracy and they started a war<br/>
 Person A: Well, no <strong>true</strong> democracy ever starts a war</p></blockquote>

<p>LessWrong has an article about <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/jsh/strategic_choice_of_identity/">choosing a small identity</a> to bootstrap a larger worldview. Identities like &#8220;growth mindset&#8221; or &#8220;someone who tries new things&#8221; or a &#8220;jack of all trades.&#8221; Perhaps the best one is &#8220;truth-seeker,&#8221; which is a more useful mindset to have than any religious or political identity that can lead someone to become closed minded when they perceive a threat to their group&#8217;s values.</p>

<p>Studies have found that when a sports fan&#8217;s team loses, <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2013/09/20/224148230/diet-of-defeat-why-football-fans-mourn-with-high-fat-food">junk food sales go up</a>. Jonathan Haidt has written about how non-violent sport is probably an outlet for the tribalism we previously needed to survive.</p>

<p>A recent Pew Social Trends study has found that millenials are the generation <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2014/03/07/millennials-in-adulthood/">least inclined to identify with political and religious institutions</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Pew Research Center surveys show that half of Millennials (50%) now describe themselves as political independents and about three-in-ten (29%) say they are not affiliated with any religion. These are at or near the highest levels of political and religious disaffiliation recorded for any generation in the quarter-century that the Pew Research Center has been polling on these topics.</p></blockquote>

<p>If you identify as a Democrat then you will probably be personally offended when Obama does something that goes against your values (every president will dissapoint their supporter base on some issues), and you&#8217;ll probably feel your blood pressure go up every time you see a clip of FOX news. Making matters worse these days, search engines are increasingly using algorithms to return results that are relevant based on previous searches. This means that someone who has spent time searching for political content will get more political content in future internet searches, and someone that reads conservative websites often will find conservative websites in their search results more often.</p>

<p>Bill Maher has explained how people have less in common than they used to, now that people all get customised stories based on what they&#8217;ve clicked on in the past:</p>

New Rule: The Sparkletts guy must tell me why nobody talks around the water cooler anymore. But, wait, I think I know why. It&#8217;s because as a culture we don&#8217;t have enough in common anymore.

And that&#8217;s because the Internet, which was supposed to unite the world, has become too adept at serving us personalized content. Do you know what I saw on Yahoo&#8217;s front page this morning? No, you don&#8217;t, because mine isn&#8217;t the same as yours. People get newsfeeds now that just spit back customized stories based on what we&#8217;ve clicked on in the past.

So, I, for example, might see a lot of stories about pot, American history, and, of course &#8220;Christian Mingle.&#8221;

Whereas, Ted Nugent just gets ads for Prozac and bullets. 

So, yes, welcome to the brave new world of micro-targeting which &#8211; look, admittedly is often harmless. No one gets hurt if my computer tells me, &#8220;You bought &#8216;James Taylor&#8217;s Greatest Hits.&#8217; You might also enjoy this pillow and these sleeping pills.&#8221; 

Or, &#8220;You&#8217;ve shown an interest in &#8216;nipple slips.&#8217; Here&#8217;s every picture ever of Tara Reid.&#8221; [slide of Tara Reid] 

&#8220;And here&#8217;s an article about another slippery boob.&#8221; [slide of Ted Cruz]

But, consider this: back in the olden days, this is how people spent their time on the subway. [older slide of crowded subway] Amazing, isn&#8217;t it? Everyone is reading a newspaper and no one is masturbating. 

Here&#8217;s a subway car today. [three people sit staring at hand-held devices] Everyone is playing &#8220;Angry Birds,&#8221; and no one is getting news. Or, if they are, it&#8217;s their Facebook newsfeed, which is now how a third of their &#8211; of adults get their news.

And this month, Facebook unveiled an app called &#8220;Paper,&#8221; which Mark Zuckerberg calls &#8211; quote &#8211; &#8220;the best personalized newspaper in the world.&#8221;

Yeah, I suppose the Washington Post is okay, like when it uncovered Watergate, but Facebook lets you share pictures of your lunch and do this? [he gestures and makes goofy face] 

But&#8230;but, hey, if one of the richest companies in America can get richer by making you a little stupider every time you look at your phone, small price to pay. 

And, boy, does it make you stupider. &#8220;Paper&#8221; tracks the news you&#8217;re interested in and gives you more of that and less of everything else, never burdening you with contradictory information or telling you anything new. That&#8217;s what makes it news. 

But, only seeing the stuff that confirms the opinions you already have isn&#8217;t news. It&#8217;s Fox News.

The reason so many Americans, for example, think climate change is a hoax, is that their only source for science news is Glenn Beck, Fox and  Matt Drudge, the &#8220;cracker trifecta.&#8221; 

Newspapers may be old-fashioned, but here&#8217;s what we&#8217;re losing if you never see one: they are trying to tell you what&#8217;s actually important, not just what&#8217;s important to you. You may not read the whole paper, but you at least see headlines making you aware that something&#8217;s going on outside of your micro-targeted world of fashion or music or wiccans or zombies or whatever you&#8217;re into. 

I don&#8217;t enjoy reading about climate change. It&#8217;s depressing. But, for example, I recently saw a headline that said jellyfish are taking over the ocean. Which I found alarming.

So, I read the article. And, apparently, yes, jellyfish are the cockroaches of the sea and will happily eat all the toxic shit we&#8217;re putting in the ocean which is killing everything else down there. But, the jellyfish are, like, &#8220;Oil? Fuckin&#8217; love it!&#8221; &#8220;Plastic? I had some for lunch.&#8221;

Yes, jellyfish: 500 million years of yechhh&#8230;and now their time has come. [laughter] 

And, no one is going to hear about it unless a jellyfish washes up on a beach and exposes its nipple.

<p>Mark Scott, managing director of the ABC, has warned Christians not to get <a href="http://www.biblesociety.org.au/news/mark-scott-christians-beware-christian-bubble">trapped in a bubble</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“The new media environment presents a great risk for Christians to retreat. There will be in a media sense, a massive global market for Christians to listen to Christian music, to read Christian books, to see Christian films, to partake in Christian blogs, to comment on each other’s Christian Facebook pages and to live in that Christian world.</p></blockquote>

<p>The same can be true for atheists, Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians and everyone else who reads only information that agrees with their preferred label. If a Democrat spends 90% of their time reading websites that have a liberal perspective, then it might be harder for them to empathise with someone who disagrees with their political philosophy, and we see that all the time in snarky comments that seek to dogpile critics rather than address their concerns.</p>

<p>Hume said that truth emerges from arguments between friends, and if you want to find the truth you need to be prepared to listen to people that disagree, and start from the position that you could be wrong. Especially in this day and age of filter bubbles and personalised news feeds, we must be vigilant about how much time we spend cloistered inside media that reflect our own viewpoints, and not be afraid to find dissenting voices. If people constrain themselves to only engaging in discussion with groups of people with the same intrests, social capital could go down as we lose the water cooler.</p>
