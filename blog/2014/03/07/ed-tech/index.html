<div class="entry-content"><p>The New York Times has some interesting coverage of recent developments in Ed-Tech. One of the big ones is that the US&#8217;s SAT system is going to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/06/education/major-changes-in-sat-announced-by-college-board.html?_r=0">partner with Khan Academy</a> to deliver a classroom-focussed college admissions system, and provide preparation to everyone, rather than just the rich that can afford test prep classes. Free preparation for one of the most important US college admissions tests is a <a href="http://khanacademy.com/sat">major coup for the organisation</a> that Bill Gates and others have backed to improve the learning quality of students around the world.</p>

<blockquote><p>English language curriculums built entirely on a digital platform — replacing written textbooks, worksheets or printed study guides — are about to enter the market from several companies, with promises that they will change the nature of classroom learning across the country.</p>

<p>The Obama administration has pledged to provide high-speed Internet connections to 15,000 schools over the next two years, districts are purchasing tablets and laptops for students, and on Friday, President Obama announced $400 million in corporate commitments from the software companies Adobe and Prezi, which will donate software to teachers. Meanwhile, other companies are rushing in.</p>

<p>On Monday at an education conference in Austin, Tex., Joel Klein, the former chancellor of New York City public schools and the current chief executive of Amplify, the education unit of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, will introduce a digital English language arts curriculum for middle school.</p>

<p>Mr. Klein said the new software, which will run on a variety of devices and is priced at $45 per student a year, includes videos, games and vocabulary apps and allows teachers to track student writing and give feedback directly online. “This is not a bunch of souped-up PDFs,” Mr. Klein said, referring to digital versions of print documents.</p>

<p>McGraw Hill, the textbook publisher, will also announce this week that it has signed a partnership with StudySync, a company that creates digital English curriculum tools that have been deployed in 22,000 classrooms and are priced at about a third of Amplify’s rate.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/magazine/no-child-left-untableted.html?pagewanted=all">No Child Left Untableted</a></p>

<blockquote><p>The key, he said, is personalized learning — breaking free of the mass-production model, tailoring the curriculum to the student and redesigning it around proven competence rather than accrued face time, so that each student can go at his own pace. “Now your job is not to dispense knowledge,” Britt told the trainees. “It’s to facilitate learning. No longer is the teacher the bottleneck between students and knowledge. Rather, the teacher architects the environment — in the classroom, on the tablet, online, everywhere.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Textbook efficiency:</p>

<blockquote><p>When I asked Arne Duncan, the U. S. secretary of education, about the increasing amounts of money being spent by school systems on educational technology, he said: “We spend precious taxpayer money now on textbooks, buses, milk, all kinds of things. The real question is, ‘How do you spend more effectively?’ ” Electronic readers could make textbooks better and cheaper, he said. “As a country we spend $7 billion to $8 billion a year on textbooks. My simple question is, ‘Why?’ ” Referring to the six-year textbook-adoption cycle some states still use, Duncan said, “That’s a Neanderthal system.”</p></blockquote>

<p>GigaOm has a good <a href="http://gigaom.com/2014/02/25/how-khan-academy-is-using-design-to-pave-the-way-for-the-future-of-education/">take on the design of Khan Academy</a></p>

<blockquote><p>Since its founding in 2008 by former hedge fund analyst Salman Khan — who was making math videos in his spare time to tutor his cousins — Khan Academy has emerged as a new way to learn; one that is self paced, approachable, conversational and tries to help students master individual subjects before moving onto the next. Bill Gates is a big fan, as is Google and its chairman Eric Schmidt as well as Netflix CEO Reed Hastings — all of these big names invested in the company.</p>

<p>While millions of users access the site and watch its content, 30,000 classrooms also use the videos for in-school teaching and teachers (they call them coaches) can also use the software to track student progress. All of these moving parts are tied together by an understated design ethos that highlights simplicity, puts the content first, and tries remove frustration and friction from learning.</p></blockquote>

<p>Audrey Watters has a good roundup of the politics of the &#8220;Open&#8221; label being applied beyond open source tech, especially in Ed-Tech where &#8220;open&#8221; online courses <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2013/12/16/top-ed-tech-trends-2013-open/">more commonly means &#8221;<strong>open for business</strong>&#8221;</a>. She has an extensive discussion of MOOC hype <a href="http://hackeducation.com/blog/tag.php?Search_Tag=ed-tech%20trends%202013">in a 2013 rundown</a> that is well worth a read.</p>
