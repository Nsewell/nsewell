<div class="entry-content"><p>Macleans has great articles. American politics, like in many other OECD countries, as politicians <a href="http://www.macleans.ca/politics/america-dumbs-down/">communicate in simple soundbites while giving campaign funders and corporate lobbyists most of the power</a></p>

<blockquote><p>The trends are not encouraging. In 1978, 42 per cent of Americans reported that they had read 11 or more books in the past year. In 2014, just 28 per cent can say the same, while 23 per cent proudly admit to not having read even one, up from eight per cent in 1978. Newspaper and magazine circulation continues to decline sharply, as does viewership for cable news. The three big network supper-hour shows drew a combined average audience of 22.6 million in 2013, down from 52 million in 1980. While 82 per cent of Americans now say they seek out news digitally, the quality of the information they’re getting is suspect. Among current affairs websites, Buzzfeed logs almost as many monthly hits as the Washington Post&#8230;</p>

<p>By 2008, journalist Susan Jacoby was warning that the denseness—“a virulent mixture of anti-rationalism and low expectations”—was more of a permanent state. In her book, The Age of American Unreason, she posited that it trickled down from the top, fuelled by faux-populist politicians striving to make themselves sound approachable rather than smart. Their creeping tendency to refer to everyone—voters, experts, government officials—as “folks” is “symptomatic of a debasement of public speech inseparable from a more general erosion of American cultural standards,” she wrote</p>

<p>An aversion to complexity—at least when communicating with the public—can also be seen in the types of answers politicians now provide the media. The average length of a sound bite by a presidential candidate in 1968 was 42.3 seconds. Two decades later, it was 9.8 seconds. Today, it’s just a touch over seven seconds and well on its way to being supplanted by 140-character Twitter bursts.</p>

<p>Little wonder then that distrust—of leaders, institutions, experts, and those who report on them—is rampant. A YouGov poll conducted last December found that three-quarters of Americans agreed that science is a force for good in the world. Yet when asked if they truly believe what scientists tell them, only 36 per cent of respondents said yes. Just 12 per cent expressed strong confidence in the press to accurately report scientific findings. (Although according to a 2012 paper by Gordon Gauchat, a University of North Carolina sociologist, the erosion of trust in science over the past 40 years has been almost exclusively confined to two groups: conservatives and regular churchgoers. Counterintuitively, it is the most highly educated among them—with post-secondary education—who harbour the strongest doubts.)</p>

<p>The term “elitist” has become one of the most used, and feared, insults in American life. Even in the country’s halls of higher learning, there is now an ingrained bias that favours the accessible over the exacting.</p>

<p>The digital revolution, which has brought boundless access to information and entertainment choices, has somehow only enhanced the lowest common denominators—LOL cat videos and the Kardashians. Instead of educating themselves via the Internet, most people simply use it to validate what they already suspect, wish or believe to be true. It creates an online environment where Jenny McCarthy, a former Playboy model with a high school education, can become a worldwide leader of the anti-vaccination movement, naysaying the advice of medical professionals.</p>

<p>Most perplexing, however, is where the stupid is flowing from. As conservative pundit David Frum recently noted, where it was once the least informed who were most vulnerable to inaccuracies, it now seems to be the exact opposite. “More sophisticated news consumers turn out to use this sophistication to do a better job of filtering out what they don’t want to hear,” he blogged.</p></blockquote>

<p>Emma Teitel notes that digital media is making the problem worse, with the public experiencing information overload as society rapidly changes, as outlined in Alvin Toffler&#8217;s <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Shock">Future Shock</a></strong>. She <a href="http://www.macleans.ca/culture/going-viral-at-the-expense-of-our-privacy/">writes</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>60 per cent of Canadians would not change their Internet or phone behaviour if they suspected the government was spying on them. We are clearly fascinated by the secretly recorded outbursts of the morally bankrupt and grotesque—à la Rob Ford and Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling—but when it comes to the erosion of privacy among normal people at the hands of government and big corporations, we’re more or less ambivalent. It appears we’d rather share spoken-word poems on Facebook about the vacuous nature of social media than make a stink about the possibility that our government and the telecom companies that pander to it are taking advantage of us while we do.</p></blockquote>
