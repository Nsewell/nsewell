<div class="entry-content"><p>Google&#8217;s acquisition of Motorola is likely to pay off, with glowing reviews of their new $130 smartphone putting all of their competitors on notice. Last year Nokia announced a <a href="http://www.cnet.com/products/nokia-lumia-520/">$100 Lumia 520 smartphone</a> running Windows phone, and Google and Microsoft are going to continue to try to undercut each other to vie for dominance of the developing market. IDC data indicate that in 2013, the average worldwide <a href="http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS24461213">price of a smartphone was $337</a>, down from $387 in 2012. With Google using Motorola to dramatically undercut the market prices are likely to fall faster than anticipated, in a move that will be a major win for consumers in developing markets. IDC predicted that the average worldwide smartphone price would fall to $265 by 2017, while the North American average of $531 would rise to $567, but with Google and Microsoft pushing entry level phones I predict it will go down significantly.</p>

<p>Recently, it&#8217;s hit the news that parents in an Idaho school district successfully campaigned to remove Sherman Alexie&#8217;s acclaimed Young Adult novel, The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian. The multi award winning book was pulled from the shelves after parents objected to its coarse language, references to masturbation, and political criticism of Christian conservatives. Parents called <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140428/11320827052/censorious-parent-calls-cops-teen-giving-away-books-local-park.shtml">the cops on a student at the high school</a> giving out free copies of the book to peers after the school pulled the book.</p>

<p>The American Library Association has pointed out how farcical censorship is when the #1 most banned book, <strong>Captain Underpants</strong>, <a href="http://ncac.org/censorship-article/state-of-censorship-unabridged-contributions-from-our-participants/">is read by parents to children</a>. The potty humour in the book is designed to make young children giggle and parents roll their eyes. Challenges to the book highlight the absurdity of one group of parents deciding on behalf of every other family in a library district what morals the children are to be raised with.</p>

<p>The National Coalition Against Censorship highlights in their Kids Rights to Read Project that the majority of the most influential books of all time were at one time censored:</p>

<p><img src="/images/ncac-banned.png" title="&#34;70% of 'Books that shaped America' have been banned&#34;" alt="&#34;70% of 'Books that shaped America' have been banned&#34;"></p>

<p>The actions of the student in distributing the book, which they love, to younger students in year 10 shows that an intergeneration values disconnect is not going to be solved with parental censorship of the media or libraries, and ultimately highlight why teenagers are justified in abandoning the values of their parents.</p>

<p>Attempts at book censorship are going to become increasingly farcical when technology allows individual consumers to buy books that aren&#8217;t stocked in their local library or their local state. <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/wp/online/87-of-american-adults-now-access-the-internet-41043/">97% of 18-29</a> year olds use the internet.</p>

<p>2014 figures show that tablet ownership in the US is up to <a href="http://www.marketingcharts.com/wp/online/us-tablet-ownership-update-january-2014-39508/">44% of the adult population</a>, and <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media//Files/Reports/2014/PIP_E-reading_011614.pdf">50% of adults have either a tablet or an e-reader</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/tablet-ereader.png" title="&#34;50% of adults in the United States how have either a tablet or an e-reader&#34;" alt="&#34;50% of adults in the United States how have either a tablet or an e-reader&#34;"></p>

<p>Nielsen has slightly higher estimates of Smartphone ownership among teens, estimating that 70 percent of teens aged 13-17 <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/newswire/2013/ring-the-bells-more-smartphones-in-students-hands-ahead-of-back.html">own smartphones</a>, while 79% of young adults aged 18-24 do.</p>

<p>Figures from September 2013 show that <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media//Files/Reports/2013/PIP_Tablets%20and%20e-readers%20update_101813.pdf">46% of 16-17 year olds have tablets</a>, while 24% have e-book readers. 91% of them have cell phones, while 68% have smartphones.</p>

<p><img src="/images/pew-smartphone-household.png" title="Pew Household income vs Smartphone ownership rates" ></p>

<p>Smartphones are owned by only 41% of people in with a household income under $30,000 US, rising to 84% of those with household incomes over $150,000. Hopefully with entry level smartphones offering decent performance at US $100, cellphone customers in low income households will move to smartphones in a few years.</p>

<p>One of the other major areas where censorship has played out is in sex education, where conservative states have passed laws banning factual sex education and enforcing ineffectual abstinence-only curricula. With smartphone access to apps by <a href="https://healthcenter.uoregon.edu/Home/SexPositive.aspx">Oregon university</a> and other providers these laws will quickly become redundant, as teens seek out factual, unbiased information online.</p>

<p>Any ideology, political or religious, that requires the censorship of every family within a school district is not going to survive the age of the internet.</p>
