<div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve written before about how [eye tracking can predict political preferences[(/blog/2014/04/05/eye-tracking). People who put more effort into actively avoiding disgusting images are more likely to be politically conservative:</p>

<div class="figure"><a href="http://m.motherjones.com/politics/2014/04/inquiring-minds-john-hibbing-physiology-ideology"><img src="/images/mj-collage-pol.png" link="http://m.motherjones.com/politics/2014/04/inquiring-minds-john-hibbing-physiology-ideology" title="Tracking which images you look at can predict your disgust response, and your political preference" ><p>Tracking which images you look at can predict your disgust response, and your political preference</span></a></div>


<p>I absolutely loved reading Jonathan Haidt&#8217;s <em><a href="http://righteousmind.com/">The Righteous Mind - why good pepole are divided by religion and politics</a></em>, which makes a strong argument that our genetics influence our political leanings. David Pizarro and Jonathan Haidt have built upon earlier work on the disgust reflex to explore how the reflex to spit out impure food is triggered when we think of disgusting sex practices, or &#8220;unclean&#8221; people. Haidt ran a study where he asked Americans how they would feel if an old woman needed a rag to clean a toilet, and she <a href="http://www.commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Haidt-Moral-Dumfounding-When-Intuition-Finds-No-Reason.pdf">ripped up an old American flag she didn&#8217;t want</a>. Conservatives were furious at the sacrilige of tearing up a flag in the privacy of her own house, while liberals argued that the community should tolerate a woman choosing how to use her own flag inside her own house. Another study asked how people would feel about a <a href="http://faculty.virginia.edu/haidtlab/articles/haidt.hersh.2001.sexual-morality.pub021.pdf">34 year old woman masturbating while cuddling her favourite teddy bear</a>. People who felt disgusted often put forward religious arguments about the design of the body. Pizarro, in a follow up, found that people were more likely to be judgemental of the unusual sex practice when standing next to a reminder to wash their hands:</p>

<div class="video-info" >What does a disgusting image have to do with how you vote? Equipped with surveys and experiments, psychologist David Pizarro demonstrates a correlation between sensitivity to disgusting cues &#8211; a photo of feces, an unpleasant odor &#8211; and moral and political conservatism.

<p>Critically, Pizarro explains how Nazi propaganda taught German children to hate Jews because they were <a href="http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/thumb.htm">reviled as filthy people</a>, with books teaching &#8220;Just look at these guys! The louse-infested beards! The filthy, protruding ears, those stained, fatty clothes&#8230; Jews often have an unpleasent sweetish odor. If you have a good nose, you can smell the Jews.&#8221; Disgust continues to be one of a <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2012/08/anti_gay_bigotry_online_analyzing_homophobic_comments_can_disarm_the_hate_.html">range of tactics</a> put forward by those willing to limit the rights of a social group, or <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/north-carolina-pastor-calls-death-gays-lesbians-trapping-electric-fence-article-1.1082160">ostracise them completely</a>.</p>

<p>One of the clearest indicators that the Christian notion of the <em>Witness of the Holy Spirit</em> doesn&#8217;t exist is that it gets confused with personal bigotry. One Chrisitan minister in Sydney has married a former sex worker, but many Chrisitans, while they praise this action as emblematic of forgiveness and grace central to the religion, admit that the would never be able to accept a woman with an extensive past sexual history.</p>

<p>Recently Michael Sam was the first openly gay player drafted to the United States National Football League. Recently a Dallas TV panellist walked off the set when the show broadcast a kiss between Sam and his boyfriend in celebration of the draft, despite earlier showcasing <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/05/16/anti-gay-texas-talk-show-host-gets-her-heart-pounded-by-half-naked-male-strippers/">topless male strippers in the program</a>. Now the editor of <em>Wing Nut Daily</em> has said that pepole who feel a disgust reaction at seeing a homosexual kiss are experiencing &#8221;<a href="http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/david-kupelian-says-revulsion-yucky-michael-sam-kiss-something-god">something from God</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Richard Beck has been <a href="http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com.au/2013/02/the-psychology-of-christian-purity.html">writing on this for years</a>, and the No Shame Movement has started to <a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/god/church/how-not-talk-about-purity">pick up traction within mainstream evangelicalism</a>. With ongoing <a href="http://prospect.org/article/next-christian-sex-abuse-scandal">sex abuse scandals</a> all over the evangelical world, evangelical leaders can no longer drag their heels on changes that everyone knows need to happen.</p>
