<div class="entry-content"><p>Government propagandists for Customs are now broadacasting that asylum seekers will <a href="http://www.customs.gov.au/webdata/resources/files/Storyboard-Afghanistan.pdf">suffer physical and mental harm in detention camps</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/customs-propaganda.jpg"></p>

<p>The Australian public is being kept in the dark like never before about the number of boat arrivals and the conditions of the detention camps. The public is allowed to know that the camps <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-28/immigration-department-breaks-down-asylum-detention-costs/4718730">cost $1.5 billion each year to operate</a>, but the government has effectively denied Australian journalists any real coverage of the conditions in the camps. The politically motivated <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/expulsion-from-nauru-false-and-ridiculous-exiled-judge-20140121-316xa.html">expulsion of a judge from Nauru</a> before an inquiry into their detention camps is another way in which secrecy is being maintained.</p>

<p>The Abbott government claims that they have a mandate to &#8220;stop the boats.&#8221; It&#8217;s unclear if the people that gave them that mandate understand what is happening with their money, in their name.</p>

<p>Some Myths debunked by the <a href="http://www.refugeecouncil.org.au/f/myth-email.php">Refugee Council</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Myth: Refugees can receive social security payments simply because they are refugees.
Fact: Refugees receive the same social security benefits as everyone else.
Myth: Refugees living in Australia receives a larger weekly allowance from Centrelink than age pensioners.
Fact: A single person with no dependent children applying for the Newstart Allowance (whether or not he or she is a refugee) receives over $200.00 LESS per fortnight than a single age pensioner.
Myth: Refugees receive higher rates of payment under Centrelink programs than other Australians.
Fact: Centrelink payments are calculated at exactly the same rate for both refugees and non-refugees.
Myth: Asylum seekers can receive Centrelink payments.
Fact: Asylum seekers are not entitled to the same forms of financial support as citizens or permanent residents.
Myth: Illegal immigrants can receive Centrelink payments.
Fact: Only Australian citizens and permanent residents can receive social security payments from Centrelink and illegal immigrants are certainly not entitled to such support.
Myth: “If you cross the Afghan border illegally, you get shot” (and so on).
Fact: The list of penalties for illegally crossing the border has been fabricated and has no basis in law.
Myth: Asylum seekers who cross national borders without valid papers are breaking the law.
Fact: Asylum seekers do not break any Australian laws simply by arriving on boats or without authorisation.
Myth: Asylum seekers, upon their arrival in Australia, are “given” a job, an interpreter, a driver’s license, a social security number, welfare payments and credit cards.
Fact: Asylum seekers are not automatically &#8220;given&#8221; any of these things upon arrival.
Myth: Refugees and asylum seekers receive higher rates of payment under Centrelink programs than age pensioners or other Australians.
Fact: Centrelink payments are calculated at exactly the same rate for both refugees and non-refugees.
Myth: This e-mail has been endorsed by Mr Maurice Kriss, a Sydney-based Barrister at Law.
Fact: This e-mail has not been endorsed by Mr Kriss.
Myth: Refugees and asylum seekers receive “all expenses paid” accommodation in Australia.
Fact: Refugees and asylum seekers do not receive free accommodation.
Myth: Refugees and asylum seekers receive cash benefits starting at $800.00 per week.
Fact: A refugee who has permanent residency in Australia is entitled to exactly the same social security benefits as any Australian citizen or permanent resident in the same circumstances - which are nowhere near $800.00 per week.
Myth: Anyone can seek asylum, provided they don’t hold a valid Australian Passport.
Fact: Anyone can seek asylum, regardless of their nationality.
Myth: No asylum application is ever refused, reasonable or unreasonable.
Fact: Asylum applications are frequently refused.
Myth: Immigration detention facilities, such as the facility on Christmas Island, are comparable to luxury hotels or holiday resorts.
Fact: High-security immigration detention centres are comparable to prisons, with the Christmas Island facility being one of the worst examples. Conditions in hotels used as &#8220;alternative places of detention&#8221; can hardly be described as luxurious.
Myth: Terrorists, drug smugglers, mass murderers and other criminals can be granted refugee status.
Fact: Providing asylum is not about harbouring criminals – it is about protecting people from persecution.
Myth: Refugees are “lucky winners in the easiest game on earth”.
Fact: It is outrageous to claim that refugees are “lucky” people who have been through an “easy” experience.
Myth: All of the detainees at the Scherger detention centre are being accepted into Australia.
Fact: It is not possible to make this claim because applications of the detainees at Scherger are still being assessed.
Myth: Asylum seekers in detention receive a pension and hardship allowance, the sum of which is double the amount received by age pensioners.
Fact: Asylum seekers in detention do not receive any form of financial assistance.
Myth: Asylum seekers in detention receive $50.00 a day for spending money.
Fact: Detainees in the Scherger facility do not receive cash payments.
Myth: One quarter of a tonne of chicken a day alone is cooked at the Scherger Detention Centre.
Fact: This claim is false.
Myth: Detainees at the Scherger detention centre refuse to pick up their own rubbish and there have been “massive disputes” because detainees “didn’t like the radio station” and “batteries were flat for the Nintendo games.”
Fact: These claims are false.</p></blockquote>
