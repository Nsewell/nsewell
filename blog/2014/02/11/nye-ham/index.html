<div class="entry-content"><p>Bill Nye recently debated the world&#8217;s leading apologist for Young Earth Creationism, Ken Ham. Ham believes that nothing can ever dispove a 6,000 year old earth, and that <a href="www.awkwardmomentsbible.com/unicorns/">unicorns are real animals</a>. Many atheists and scientists opposed the debate, as they were concerned it would legitimise pseudoscience as worthy of scientific consideration, and give money to Ham to build his full scale &#8220;replica&#8221; of the ark. After the event most commentators decided that Ham shot himself in the foot by relying on the bible, but admitting that his beliefs will never change:</p>

<p>Ken Ham admitted that creationism was not a scientific position by conceding that it had never made any predictions about the natural world, and it isn&#8217;t falsifiable. 92% of respondents on a <a href="http://www.christiantoday.com/article/bill.nye.vs.ken.ham.debate.live.stream.free.watch.online.creation.vs.evolution.debate.here.start.time/35688.htm">poll in ChristianityToday</a> thought that Bill Nye won the debate, and Pat Robertson said that the idea that &#8220;it all came about in 6,000 years is nonsense&#8221; and &#8220;let&#8217;s not make a joke of ourselves&#8221;</p>

Right Wing Watch reports on the extreme rhetoric and activities of key right-wing figures and organizations by showing their views in their own words. In this video, Pat Robertson says he disagrees with Young Earth Creationism and considers it a &#8220;joke.&#8221;</div>

<p>Slate notes that HBO is airing a documentary about the <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/02/creationism_is_dangerous_hbo_documentary_questioning_darwin_shows_how_fundamentalism.html">rise of creationism in America</a>, with the following quote from a pastor:</p>

<blockquote><p>“If somewhere in the Bible I were to find a passage that says two plus two equals five,” the pastor states plainly, “I wouldn’t question what I’m reading in the Bible. I would believe it—accept it as true and then do my best to work it out and to understand it.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The problem is that the bible asks belivers to think that pi is 3 in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Kings+7%3A23&amp;version=KJV">1 Kings</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>And he made a molten sea, <strong>ten cubits</strong> from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of <strong>thirty cubits did compass it</strong> round about.</p></blockquote>

<p>Biblical literalists have a range of bogus explanations for why these numbers are true, without embracing the idea that mathematics is wrong. We don&#8217;t call someone a theistic mathematician if they believe in the accuracy of pi, or a theistic meteorologist if they believe rain comes from clouds rather than storehouses in heaven. The mythical beasts that were included in the King James Bible, like <a href="http://classic.net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=Satyr">Satyrs</a>, <a href="http://classic.net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=unicorn">Unicorns</a> and <a href="http://classic.net.bible.org/dictionary.php?word=cockatrice">Cockatrices</a> have mostly been retranslated in modern bibles. It was said in relation to the Nephilim that &#8221;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_Giant">There&#8217;s a sucker born every minute</a>&#8221; and most people find the mythical creatures laughable:</p>

<p><img src="/images/bible-dinosaur.jpg"></p>

<p>Other than the occasional <a href="http://galileowaswrong.com/">hick</a>, nobody challenges the heliocentric model, and the flat earth society seems to have fallen over the edge of the disc. Other than <a href="/blog/2013/10/12/plait-spherist/">Phil Plait</a>, nobody decries the spherist bias in the media. Evolution is one of the only areas where children are encouraged to disrupt their science classes, and United States legislatures are trying to encourage the teaching of nonsense. Creationists have managed to get <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/02/09/the_scary_future_of_creationism_in_america/">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> in federal funding in Australia to persue their secterian agenda, and are set to introduce creationism as an &#8220;alternate perspective&#8221; into the history curriculum during the national curriculum review.</p>

<p>Bill Nye&#8217;s biggest appeal in his debate was that for Western countries to be globally competitive in the 21st century, we need to empower science educators to give children a love of learning that will prepare them to be innovators in the rapidly changing technology sector. Religiously and politically motivated campaigns instead want to cast doubt about scientific consensus on topics like evolution and climate change, and are well financed to do so. Anyone with a love of science needs to fight the underhanded campaigns that are trying undermine science education in school classrooms.</p>
