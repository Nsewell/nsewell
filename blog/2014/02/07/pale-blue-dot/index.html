<div class="entry-content"><p>The curiosity rover has shot an image of the sky in mars, with Earth appearing as a <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/07/curiosity_sends_back_pale_blue_dot_picture_of_earth_from_mars/">tiny speck of light</a>
<img src="/images/pale-blue-dot-mars.jpg"></p>

<p>When you hear about <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2014/02/06/an-open-letter-to-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-a-young-stranger-six-thousand-miles-and-a-dozen-years-away-2/">four year olds vowing to slaughter their enemies</a> in a war that has claimed the lives of <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-06/102c000-children-killed-in-syrian-civil-war3a-un-report/5241448">10,000 children</a> think about how great the bloodshed is over control of such a tiny fraction of such a small planet. Shane Smith <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOndtUcRXdU&amp;list=PLw613M86o5o5BNP8ls1TNDLLHVEi1Mopg&amp;t=11m18s">notes</a> that at the same time as people are looking at the surface of mars on their smartphones, uneducated Afghan boys are being used in suicide attacks against civilians on Muslim holy days.</p>

<p>It brings to mind one of Carl Sagan&#8217;s most <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9TIeuBF9Ss">famous speeches</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Look again at that dot. That&#8217;s here. That&#8217;s home. That&#8217;s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every &#8220;superstar,&#8221; every &#8220;supreme leader,&#8221; every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</p>

<p>The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.</p>

<p>Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.</p>

<p>The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.</p>

<p>It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we&#8217;ve ever known.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Callum Southerland&#8217;s long version of the film is worth watching:</p>

Excerpts from Carl Sagan&#8217;s Pale Blue Dot: A Vision of the Human Future in Space and Cosmos.  More specifically, from the chapter titled You Are Here.  I edited together the audio from the audiobook, and added the video from:

- Apocalypse: The Second World War
- BBC&#8217;s Planet Earth
- BBC&#8217;s The Root of All Evil with Richard Dawkins
- BBC&#8217;s Walking with Cavemen
- BBC&#8217;s Wonders of the Solar System with Brian Cox
- Carl Sagan&#8217;s Cosmos
- Discovery&#8217;s Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking

The music is &#8220;The Science of Faith&#8221;, &#8220;La Fleur&#8221; and &#8220;For Love of the Dame&#8221; by Michael Giacchino from the Lost soundtrack.

The Carl Sagan Tribute Series will continue, please subscribe to my channel if you wish to be among the first to see my newest videos.
