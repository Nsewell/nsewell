<div class="entry-content"><p>Interesting report on <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2378590">SSRN</a> on the use of tech in schoos, and the youth perspectives on network restrictions and monitoring. Students expressed frustration at the top down focus on technology; &#8220;while many participants reported positive feelings around the current state of technology in their schools, some students seemed frustrated about ongoing initiatives to provide them with tablets for academic purposes. Several participants stated that they would have preferred new laptops to new tablets.&#8221; Some students expressed frustration at inequalities between the ICT resources of different schools.</p>

<p>78% of young people now have a cell phone, and almost <a href="http://pewinternet.org/Reports/2013/Teens-and-Tech.aspx">half (47%) of those own smartphones</a>. A large number of students refuse to hand in their devices, even though they don&#8217;t plan to use them in school hours. A number of students felt frustrated at the disconnect between ICT policy and the concept of the school trusting their students. Some students use Wifi networks from neighbouring buildings because of speed constraints, and blocking of websites that have information on news topics like rapes in India. The schools need to follow Childrenâ€™s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) guidelines, which don&#8217;t include the blocking of social media sites, even though most schools include it. More public schools than private schools block sites like youtube, which has both &#8220;distracting&#8221; and objectionable content, as well as educational content. Some students found that blocking Facebook blocked educational sites like Khan Academy that use OAuth to login. Students that saved homework on personal email accounts weren&#8217;t able to access them from some school networks.</p>

<p>37% of students admit to bypassing filtering themselves, with simple workarounds like SSL/TLS sites allowed. Some students use VPNs on their own devices. Blocking encrypted tunneling is beyond most school ICT administrators, and there&#8217;s a growing recognition that censorship in institutions like public libraries <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/09/cost-censorship-libraries-10-years-under-childrens-internet-protection-act">is ineffective and curtails free speech</a>. In a telling statement, one student reveals that teachers sometimes ask their students how to bypass filters.</p>

<p>One of the most problematic issues in the paper is the privacy issue. Schools have legitimate reasons to use screen sharing tools to prevent disruptive behaviour, but this also gives teachers mostly unaccountable access to record private student communications. Most of the privacy protections are in school policy, rather than in the technology itself.</p>

<p>Students have a range of legitimate reasons to bypass censorship, and legitimate concerns around their own privacy. Schools have opened up as a new front in the classic war of <a href="http://boingboing.net/2012/08/23/civilwar.html">users vs owners</a>. The shift from from centrally controlled mainframes to user centric PC&#8217;s brought a raft of security issues before <em>some</em> smartphone and tablet vendors moved to a walled garden approach.</p>

<p>ITU figures show that mobile broadband subscriptions are one of the fastest growing sectors in telecomms:</p>

<div class="figure"><a href="http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2013-e.pdf"><img src="/images/itu-2013.png" link="http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Statistics/Documents/facts/ICTFactsFigures2013-e.pdf"><p></span></a></div>


<p>It seems like the only way to be sure that your kid is getting the full educational benefit of the internet without being monitored is to buy them a mobile broadband subscription and send them to a private school. And then ask yourself why on earth we have a digital divide.</p>
