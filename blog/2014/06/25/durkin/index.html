<div class="entry-content"><p>90% of tech startups fail, but entrepreneurs don&#8217;t like to dwell on it.</p>

<p>Nikki Durkin was a young age, selling t-shirts on ebay in school, and pitching a fashion marketplace to her business studies class. She found girls like her had a wardrobe full of clothes but nothing to wear, so created &#8220;crack for women&#8221; by setting up a greymarket for fast fashion which quickly gained traction with a passionate user base who loved being able to trade the latest outfits. Nikki launched her business in a red ocean space where she might have beaten competitors if not for a series of setbacks from co-founder health issues, being treated as a terrorist by the US consulate and having two co-founders pull out just before closing a funding round.</p>

<p>Nikki has a long post that&#8217;s probably the most <a href="https://medium.com/@nikkidurkin99/my-startup-failed-and-this-is-what-it-feels-like-c5d64b3ae96b">honest and heartfelt</a> accounts from a founder I&#8217;ve read.</p>

<blockquote><p>I didn’t fail then. I couldn’t fail. This was my baby, and if it was going to fail it would be over my dead body&#8230; I told my mum I didn’t trust my gut when it came to this. My gut was telling me to quit. Problem was, my gut had told me that before in my darkest hours and I still pulled through. If I had trusted my gut then I would have quit years ago.</p>

<p>I knew the only way this was going to die was if we were killed. I am not a quitter. I owed it to myself, my team, my investors and the 99dresses community to see this through&#8230;</p>

<p>Once or twice I’d have an investor asking if I knew what an angel was, or if I also modelled because of my height, or some other unintentionally patronizing comment that I doubt any guy would be subjected to. I learned to take it all in my high-heeled stride.</p></blockquote>

<p>I can&#8217;t do justice to the post and the incredible frustration of dealing with angels and VCs that don&#8217;t close in time to save the business.</p>

<p>Nikki&#8217;s gone home from NYC to Callala Bay, with a population of 2,000. Everyone in the tech sector should want to back our entrepreneurs who want to make Australia more than just sells pepole rocks we dig out of the Pilbara, but we have to be honest about what the startup meat grinder can actually be like.</p>
