<div class="entry-content"><p>Richard Cooke writes in The Monthly that asylum seekers are unpopular because of blue class job fears resulting from globalisation:</p>

<blockquote><p>Did Australians accept relatively high levels of immigration for so long because they’re tolerant? Australians themselves don’t think so – half think we’re a racist country. Instead, Paul Keating invented a strategy that was then expanded and perfected by John Howard: placate the business community with high levels of immigration, and crack down on asylum seekers to create the appearance of control. Kevin Rudd’s alteration of this gambit caused extreme anxiety among his colleagues.</p>

<p>“To state the obvious,” Julia Gillard wrote to him in a private email immediately before her leadership challenge in 2010, “our primary is in the mid-30s; we can’t win an election with a primary like that and the issue of asylum-seekers is an enormous reason why our primary is at that low level. It is an issue working on every level – loss of control of the borders feeding into a narrative of a government that is incompetent and out of control.”</p>

<p>The public has long been opposed to asylum seekers arriving by boat. Malcolm Fraser’s decision in the mid 1970s to take in Vietnamese boat people might be one of the most politically unpopular ever undertaken in Australia – it had less than 10% support when enacted. Even Fraser started talking about deportation once significant numbers of onshore arrivals started. The golden age of asylum policy in Australia wasn’t golden, and it was never popular.</p>

<p>But despite the heat on talkback radio, there’s some doubt about whether or not the issue of boat people is as decisive as Gillard thought it was. Around a third of people rate it as one of the most important issues, but it seems to have little effect on voter intention.</p>

<p>There’s another reason governments take to refugees with such relish: this is one of the few areas where they can demonstrate resistance to globalisation without confronting vested interests or the economically powerful.</p></blockquote>

<p>Blue collar workers who voted for the LNP, wanting asylum seeker boats &#8220;stopped&#8221; must be thrilled that unemployment benefits are being cut and apprentice tradesmen are losing government assistance to buy their first tools.</p>

<p>The fact that Julia Gillard&#8217;s &#8220;no carbon tax&#8221; statement was heavily used by her opponents is a testament to the fact that honesty is a concern for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_Foundations_Theory">larger sectors of the Australian community than compassion</a>.</p>

<p>Scott Morrison has routinely misdirected the media, most recently over <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-07-31/human-rights-commission-asylum-seeker-inquiry-evidence/5639440">reports of children self-harming in offshore immigration detention</a>. Sarah Ferguson <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2014/s4057541.htm">put to Morrison on 7.30</a> &#8220;The Human Rights Commissioner Gillian Triggs says that virtually all of the 174 children on Christmas Island are sick. Children are self-harming, biting themselves, banging into furniture, swallowing poisons. How can this possibly be justified?&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>SCOTT MORRISON: Well I don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s true, for a start&#8230;</p>

<p>SARAH FERGUSON: &#8230;You&#8217;re saying that Gillian Triggs is making up the evidence about the sickness of children?</p>

<p>SCOTT MORRISON: I don&#8217;t think there is evidence of the claim that the high - the Human Rights Commissioner has made in the way that she has made it. These are difficult environments and appropriate care is provided by our people. I think they&#8217;re quite sensational claims that have been made. <strong>She herself is not a doctor</strong> and we have medical people who are there who provide that care on a daily basis.</p></blockquote>

<p>Where have I heard that before?</p>

<p>Crudely, the left-wing argument for same-sex marriage is that we need to be compassionate to gays, but the effective argument is we need to tolerate all people we don&#8217;t necessarily approve of, if there&#8217;s no substantiated evidence of harm.</p>

<p>Many LNP voters did vote to want the boats stopped, but they didn&#8217;t understand exactly what this would entail, both in the treatment of asylum seekers, as well as the coverups and lies to the Australian public.</p>
