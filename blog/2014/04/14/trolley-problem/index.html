<div class="entry-content"><p>The New York Times has a good discussion of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/books/review/would-you-kill-the-fat-man-and-the-trolley-problem.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;">Trolley Problem</a></p>

<blockquote><p>You are walking near a trolley-car track when you notice five people tied to it in a row. The next instant, you see a trolley hurtling toward them, out of control. A signal lever is within your reach; if you pull it, you can divert the runaway trolley down a side track, saving the five — but killing another person, who is tied to that spur. What do you do? Most people say they would pull the lever: Better that one person should die instead of five.</p>

<p>Now, a different scenario. You are on a footbridge overlooking the track, where five people are tied down and the trolley is rushing toward them. There is no spur this time, but near you on the bridge is a chubby man. If you heave him over the side, he will fall on the track and his bulk will stop the trolley. He will die in the process. What do you do? (We presume your own body is too svelte to stop the trolley, should you be considering noble self-sacrifice.)</p></blockquote>

<p>I loved Jonathan Haidt&#8217;s reconciliation of moral psychology with the old philosophical question, and this is an area where a lot of people are turning to hard science to understand ethical reasoning.</p>

<p>Fun facts:</p>

<blockquote><p>In 1944, new German V-1 rockets started pounding the southern suburbs of London, though they were clearly aimed at more central areas. The British not only let the Germans think the rockets were on target, but used double agents to feed them information suggesting they should adjust their aim even farther south. The government deliberately placed southern suburbanites in danger, but one scientific adviser, whose own family lived in South London, estimated that some 10,000 lives were saved as a result. A still more momentous decision occurred the following year when America dropped atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on the argument that a quick end to the war would save lives — and by macabre coincidence, the Nagasaki bomb was nicknamed Fat Man. Similar calculations are being made right now. One has only to think of collateral damage in military strikes, or of the justifications offered for torturing terrorism suspects. At their best, such reasonings are valid; at their worst, they are a writhing nest of weasels.</p></blockquote>

<p>If it is considered ethical to select which civilians die in enemy bombings, is it ethical to subject your own soldiers to <a href="http://www.nyam.org/news/press-releases/2008/3096.html">chemical weapons</a> during tests?</p>

<blockquote><p>In the early 1940s, medical scientists funded by the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service conducted painful mustard gas experiments on at least 60,000 American soldiers. The Allies, including the governments of Canada, Britain, Australia, and the United States, conducted these experiments on their own soldiers in order to identify the impact of chemical weapons on the health of soldiers.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many people see this as one of the cases of the long history of morally dubious, and often downright criminal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_experimentation_in_the_United_States">human experiments carried out without informed consent</a>. Nazi scientists during the Nuremberg trials cited American human experiments carried out without the knowledge of prison inmates.</p>

<p>In some areas it&#8217;s hard to tell whether the history of abuses of human experimentation is worse in the US or in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_human_experimentation">Nazi Germany</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_human_experimentation">Japan</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_laboratory_of_the_Soviet_secret_services">Russia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_22">North Korea</a>.</p>

<p>Many international critics successfully argue against human rights abuses in other countries, but freqently do so while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_you_are_lynching_Negroes">covering up their own</a>.</p>
