<div class="entry-content"><p>Barney Zwartz, retired religion columnist for the Age, has a good piece on the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-04-14/zwartz-sparking-the-moral-imagination-of-the-masses/5388414">messaging of refugee advocates</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The message was that [refugee advocates] were the compassionate ones, the moral ones, the real Australians. The implication, well-understood and resented by opponents, is that those who disagree with the protesters are selfish, uncaring and/or racist and/or morally torpid&#8230;</p>

<p>Stigmatising half the population is no way to persuade people; it is no way to change refugee policy. Nor do I believe it is accurate. How such a large proportion of Australians came to see people fleeing persecution as illegals, queue jumpers, economic migrants, and a threat to our national economy and security is too big a subject to tackle here, but it is the successful result of malign policy and media slanting.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is quite a complex issue indeed. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_Foundations_Theory">Moral Foundations Theory</a> shows that most political arguments touch on six core values:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Care</strong>/<strong>harm</strong> for others, protecting them from harm.<br/>
<strong>Fairness</strong>/<strong>cheating</strong>, Justice, treating others in proportion to their actions
<strong>Liberty</strong>/<strong>oppression</strong>, characterizes judgments in terms of whether subjects are tyrannized.<br/>
<strong>Loyalty</strong>/<strong>betrayal</strong> to your group, family, nation.
<strong>Authority</strong>/<strong>subversion</strong> for tradition and legitimate authority.
<strong>Sanctity</strong>/<strong>degradation</strong>, avoiding disgusting things, foods, actions.</p></blockquote>

<p>Jonathan Haidt, the theory&#8217;s author has found that people have strange ideas about the notion of Sanctity. When asked if it&#8217;s OK for an old lady to tear up an unwanted national flag to wipe down her toilet bowl, many people are disgusted and outraged, but struggle to say why it&#8217;s wrong to use her own property in the privacy of her own home in the way she wishes. The majority of people believe that the flag is a sacred symbol, and indeed the Union Jack is made up of three crucifixes. Many Australians feel a sense of social identity from their belonging to the nation state, and John Howard would not have mandated that every public school must have a national flag in 2004 if it didn&#8217;t make for powerful propaganda. When Amanda Bishop and Phil Lloyd satirised the prime minister having sex wrapped in an Australian flag liberals were amused while conservatives <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-09-20/mps-angered-over-gillard-satire-sex-scene/2908158">were out for blood</a></p>

<p>Many racists express a concern that the country is being &#8220;polluted&#8221; by migrants and their cultural values and religious beleifs. But the vast majority of people do <a href="http://www.themonthly.com.au/blog/richard-cooke/2013/07/25/1374721635/bogans-and-boat-people-pt1">not hold racist sentiments towards immigrants</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>More than 60% of us said we wanted immigration to increase or stay the same. In Germany that figure was 22%&#8230; For a bunch of racists, we are unusually tolerant.</p>

<p>In 2009 Australia had the highest level of immigration per capita in the OECD, eclipsing influxes that have caused tabloid pandemonium elsewhere. A quarter of us were born overseas, almost half have at least one overseas born parent. Interracial marriage, often identified by demographers as a truer indicator of racism than expressed attitudes, is the norm here. A majority of third generation non-English speaking immigrants intermarry, most to Anglo-Celtic Australians. Our treatment of boat people isn&#8217;t just different to how other countries treat refugees. It&#8217;s different to how Australians themselves treat immigrants of every other kind.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the real issues in modern Australia, however, is that while inner city white collar voters enjoy the benefits of globalisation, outer suburban blue collar workers feel deeply concerned about their jobs going offshore. It&#8217;s easier to sell a carbon tax to inner city architects and engineers that design solar panels than to outer suburbs steelworkers and bricklayers that see solar panels manufactured in China and shipped in. Similarly the divide over refugees may not be as much about racism as about class inequality and <a href="http://www.themonthly.com.au/blog/richard-cooke/2013/07/30/1375142271/bogans-and-boat-people-pt-2">job security concerns</a>.</p>

<p>So the Moral Foundation of Sanctity can explain racist opposition to immigration, but anyone that doesn&#8217;t want the country &#8220;polluted&#8221; by refugees would feel the same way about migrants. With the opposition to refugees greater than to migrants, there are other issues at play. Security is frequently portrayed as a major issue, and the claim that Australia&#8217;s borders and soveringnty must be &#8220;protected&#8221; is an effective argument about how people don&#8217;t want their respect for authority to be subverted by people smugglers.</p>

<p>The fact that Howard used military vessels to intercept the Tampa in the same way that customs vessels would target drug smugglers powerfully shaped Australian perceptions of the &#8220;security risk&#8221; of asylum seekers. After the September 11th attacks and 2002 Bali Bombings it became harder for liberals to criticise the use of the Australian military to repel the Tampa. Explaining that Hazara muslims are persecuted by Al-Queda, and that Iranians are mostly secularists repressed by a theocratic government has become harder ever since. The claim that asylum seekers are &#8220;illegals,&#8221; while a blatant lie that has been debunked endlessly, continues to be a powerful tool to elicit the feeling that asylum seekers and people smugglers are subverting Australia&#8217;s rules.</p>

<p>Haidt&#8217;s analysis shows that Sanctity, Authority and Loyalty are moral foundations that social conservatives prioritise, while Compassion, Fairness and Liberty are principles that liberals prioritise. Libertarian care deeply about limiting the size of government because they prioritise freedom from opression above all other moral foundations. Strongly progressive voters base their moral intuitions on compassion far more than any other moral foundation. Critically, social conservatives do not lack compassion, they just base their moral intuitions on compassion in equal proportion to other foundations.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been well established that compassion is the <a href="http://www.crikey.com.au/2013/07/29/let-them-all-come-is-stop-the-boats-for-unthinking-progressives/">only moral foundation</a> being advocated by some progressives. Unfortunately, progressive voices articulate a desire for compassion but don&#8217;t don&#8217;t seem to speak out effectively on how the Australian notion of fairness and egalitarianism is effectively manipulated.</p>

<p>Australia is one of the only countries that links our humanitarian refugee intake to the number of irregular arrivals. The notion that refugees should join a &#8220;queue&#8221; is a powerful appeal to Australia&#8217;s sense of fairness that doesn&#8217;t have simple three word slogan answers. In reality, the UNHCR had 7.1 million refugees in 2011 while <a href="http://theconversation.com/what-role-does-australia-play-in-accepting-the-worlds-refugees-8328">only 79,800 were resettled</a>, meaning that the UNHCR &#8220;queue&#8221; may not clear for any one refugee in their lifetime.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s so much more to write on when it comes to refugees, but the progressive narrative needs to move away from overrepresenting racism in the Australian community. Malcom Fraser prevented Vietnamese from making risky voyages to Australia by boat by setting up a processing centre in Indonesia that quickly processed asylum seekers and put genuine refugees on a plane to the mainland. With conflicts like <a href="http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php">Syria</a>, global refugee numbers are not going down, so the issue is going to need more than three word slogans focussed on the current electoral cycle. That will mean having regional resettlement agreements, which can&#8217;t effectively be negotiated without bipartisanship, which can&#8217;t be achieved without swinging voters on side, which can&#8217;t be achieved unless progressive rhetoric changes to inform, rather than castigate political moderates that currently buy into media misrepresentation of the issue.</p>
